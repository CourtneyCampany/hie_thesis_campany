# Abstract 

Plants must utilize external resources including light, CO~2~, water and mineral nutrients to support photosynthetic carbon (C) gain.  This photoassimilate is then allocated within the plant as the essential C resource for growth, maintenance and storage. Theory and observations suggest that C allocation and leaf physiology are optimized to maintain functional balance for external resource capture and to maximize C gain. However, the impacts of a changing climate may disrupt the proposed balance of C allocation between above and belowground pools. Variation in resource distribution and leaf physiology within tree canopies is also not fully understood, thus all canopy leaves may not follow theories of leaf optimal behavior. These unanswered questions regarding C uptake and fate of assimilated C inhibit our ability to precisely test the coordination between canopy photosynthesis and growth. To address these broad ecological questions this PhD research utilized a diverse set of experiments which manipulated resource availability and climate on *Eucalyptus* tree species. My goal was to measure aspects of resource allocation and C uptake across different scales, from leaf to whole tree, to improve physiological understanding of the processes which define tree growth and the sensitivity of these processes to changing environments.

\
First, I determined whether manipulations of soil volume would limit growth in *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings by disrupting the balance between source and sink activity. Seedlings were grown in a large range of container sizes and planted flush to the soil alongside naturally planted seedlings ('free').  Aboveground growth of seedlings in containers was negatively affected compared to free seedlings soon after the experiment started. Despite large reductions in growth across soil volume treatments, relative partitioning of mass to leaves, stems and roots was similar for all seedlings after 120 days. Leaf photosynthetic capacity decreased in containers compared to free seedlings, and was correlated to both leaf nitrogen (N) content and starch accumulation. Although belowground sink limitation resulted in a reduction of net leaf photosynthesis (*A~n~*), a mass balance model concluded that these reductions were not large enough to explain observed growth responses. As *A~n~* and growth were not tightly coordinated, the model predicted excess photosynthetic C not attributed to biomass in potted seedlings. Quantifying the fate of this excess C will be essential in evaluating feed-backs between sink strength and leaf C uptake in future studies.

\
Second, I investigated how light gradients within *Eucalyptus tereticornis* tree canopies affect the distribution of resources that define photosynthetic capacity of sun and shade leaves. Trees were grown in climate-controlled  whole tree chambers under prevailing ambient and warmed (+3 Â°C) treatments and leaf gas exchange was coupled with online C isotope discrimination to measure *A~n~*, stomatal conductance (g~s~) and mesophyll conductance (g~m~) of sun and shade leaves. Photosynthesis rates were reduced by ca. 40 % in shade leaves associated with a 75 % reduction in photosynthetically active radiation compared to sun leaves. Photosynthetic capacity (ca. 20 % lower Vcmax and Jmax) and leaf N were also lower in shade leaves than sun leaves however, g~s~ was similar. Leaf C~i~, estimated from both leaf $\delta$^13^C and gas exchange, was higher in shade leaves than sun leaves. Here, the optimization theory hypothesis that C~i~ should be optimized throughout the canopy was rejected because water use efficiency was lower in shade leaves, compared to sun leaves. When light intensity was increased from low light to high light for shade leaves both g~s~ and g~m~ increased rapidly, leading to increases in *A~n~* greater than sun leaves at the same high light environment. This rapid response of g~m~ with light enables shade leaves to respond quickly to sunflecks and represents a new mechanism underpinning leaf gas exchange responses to light. This capacity of shade leaves to adjust their physiological behavior and increase C uptake when sunflecks occur likely plays significant role in whole tree C uptake for some tree species. These findings reveal that plant resources within a canopy may be distributed to utilize sunflecks and the dynamic physiological responses of shade leaves to altered light environments must be accounted for when up-scaling leaf level measurements to predict whole canopy C gain. 

\
Finally, I examined how net aboveground C uptake correlated to tree biomass growth and whether elevated [CO~2~] and drought treatments altered C allocation patterns above or belowground in *Eucalyptus saligna* trees. Trees were grown in climate-controlled whole tree chambers (WTCs) over a period of two years with interacting treatments of two [CO~2~] (380 ppm and 620 ppm) and two watering regimes (well-watered and a four-month drought). Additionally, we utilized a novel approach to calculate total belowground C allocation (TBCA) for each WTC as the residual between the aboveground net CO~2~ uptake and aboveground C mass. Measured cumulative aboveground net C uptake correlated positively to whole tree C mass production and leaf area over the final eleven months of the experiment. Contrary to previous studies, cumulative TBCA was unaffected by either elevated CO~2~ or drought treatments. As a fraction of total aboveground net C uptake, TBCA was also found to remain relatively stable across daily time steps for all trees. Increases in C allocation to leaves were detected in elevated CO~2~ treatments, while the effects of a 4 month drought were negligible on C allocation in aboveground tissues.  These results reveal how climate change factors impact the investment of photosynthetic C in a *Eucalyptus* tree species and provide evidence that belowground processes may not be as sensitive to global change factors as previously thought. 

\
In conclusion, this PhD research addressed diverse questions regarding resource allocation in *Eucalyptus* tree species by linking leaf physiology to whole canopy C gain and allocation of photosynthetic C to whole tree growth. This study confirms that the distribution of photosynthetic resources constrain canopy C uptake, yet within canopy leaf physiology does not follow prevailing optimal theory. Results from this work reveal how quantifying the fate of photosynthetic C among tissue and ecosystem pools, beyond biomass production, is imperative to accurately assess the impacts of environmental change on tree productivity. This research offers critical empirical data needed to refine process based models which predict canopy C gain from rates of *A~n~* and forest growth models where C allocation is represented. Ultimately, this work contributes valuable information regarding the physiological and growth responses of iconic *Eucalyptus* tree species essential for reconciling the impacts of resource availability and global climate change on fragile Australian ecosystems and the productivity of *Eucalyptus* plantation forests. 

#1.1  Overview

##1.1.1 Resource allocation in plants
Plants need to extract resources including light, CO~2~, water and mineral nutrients to support growth and reproduction. To accomplish this requires energy, appropriate tissues for uptake and a transport system to deliver resources to their required destination [@grace1997allocation]. The uptake of nutrients from roots is necessary for leaf growth. Leaves then fix the C, via net photosynthesis (*A~n~*), required for growth of the entire plant. This assimilated C from source leaves, in the form of simple sugars, is in itself an essential C resource that must be allocated to the growth and maintenance of tissues or is diverted to a storage pool of carbohydrates. As a result, growth is driven by several simultaneous processes, including *A~n~*, C investment among organs, resource acquisition and metabolic costs [@korner2006plant; @fourcaud2008plant]. Gaining an understanding of the sensitivity of these processes to environmental change is crucial for predicting future terrestrial C cycling [@friedlingstein1999toward], as there is currently little consensus on how C allocation should be modeled [@franklin2012modeling; @de2014does].

##1.1.2   Resource allocation theory
Theoretically, growth under resource limitation will be maximized when investment into the acquisition of any single resource from the environment leads to an equivalent increase in growth [@bloom1985resource]. The two critical assumptions of allocation theory are that the resource in question is in fixed supply and that allocation among competing functions is mutually exclusive [@bazzaz2000reproductive]. Thus, trade-offs between different tissue C sinks will exist as resources are invested within the plant. Allocation of newly acquired resources to different tissues will then affect subsequent rates of capture of CO~2~ and soil resources [@shipley2002balanced]. In resource saturated environments plants should maximize growth by allocating resources to support leaf growth to increase C acquisition [@monsi2005factor]. Resource availability, however, is rarely saturated in natural ecosystems. As a result, shifts in allocation of external resources and assimilated C to different tissue or ecosystem components can occur.

\
Shifts in resource allocation within plants have led to two main theories regarding allocation strategies. First, the balanced growth hypothesis suggests that individual plant tissues should provide a âbalanced internal economyâ as each component supplies resources for the other [@davidson1969effect]. This functional equilibrium between tissues can then be adaptive if conditions limit *A~n~* or soil nutrient uptake [@cannell1985attributes], such that plants should allocate resources to the organ that is capturing the resource most limiting growth [@shipley2002balanced]. Changes in plant resource allocation are also theorized to be a function of allometric trajectories of plant development, independent of changes in nutrient supply [@muller2000effect]. In this strategy, investment into leaf mass increases with both stems and root, but not proportionally, as a greater allocation of biomass to the stem exists as a simple function of plant size [@zens2002sizing]. When constrained by ontogeny, plants are more likely to adjust tissue morphology, chemistry, metabolism or turnover to alter resource capture [@reich2002root]. 

##1.1.3 Tree canopy resource gradients
Incident PPFD declines exponentially with cumulative leaf area index from the top of the tree downward, creating steep light gradients within tree canopies [@monsi2005factor]. Leaf photosynthesis responds strongly and non-linearly to irradiance [@evans1995carbon]. As costs and limitations of light harvesting prevent plants from exposing all leaves to full sun [@niinemets2010review], it follows that a substantial portion of canopy C assimilation should occur in leaves with the highest exposure to light. Consequently, the distributions of resources required for *A~n~* are partially defined by canopy light gradients. As the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is related to its N content [@field1986photosynthesis], a larger investment in N to the upper canopy should yield a larger return from whole canopy C assimilation [@ellsworth1993canopy]. The supply of water also imposes limits photosynthetic C gain through direct limitations on leaf level physiology. The stomatal resistance to CO~2~ uptake is a function of the balance between transpiration losses and leaf water potentials [@farquhar1982stomatal] and sun leaves frequently experience greater water limitations in the upper canopy [@sellin2008effects; @niinemets2012optimization]. Thus, photosynthetic N investment in the upper canopy will be ineffective in enhancing *A~n~* if water supply is insufficient [@niinemets2012optimization; @peltoniemi2012co]. Overall, the allocation of soil resources within the canopy constrains leaf physiology and photosynthetic capacity, thereby regulating the efficiency of CO~2~ uptake.    

##1.1.4 Fate of assimilated carbon
Carbon allocation represents the fraction of net primary productivity distributed to different tissue components above and belowground. In trees, C allocation encompasses investment into tissue biomass production as well as fluxes including respiration, exudation and turnover rates [@litton2007carbon]. The fate of this assimilated C is regulated by the delicate balance between leaf C uptake (source) and the C sink strength of the different biomass pools. For example, the sensitivity of C source and sink activities to water and nutrient availability could lead to an imbalance between C supply and C used for tissue growth and respiration [@fatichi2014moving]. Additionally, imbalances between source and sink activity can lead to investment into carbohydrates synthesis as a transient C storage sink [@paul2001sink].

\
As woody plants have competing tissue carbohydrate sinks, growth should principally depend on the allocation of leaf C assimilate among different sink organs [@kozlowski1992carbohydrate; @lacointe2000carbon]. In response to changing environmental conditions, however, trees may adaptively shift tissue C allocation to balance growth, storage and C loss. Due to conservation of mass, it is theoretically possible to track the fates of this assimilate from leaf C uptake to their eventual destination in above and belowground pools. Although mass balance approaches can be used to quantitatively asses tree C allocation, few studies so far have been able to provide direct empirical measurements of C allocation among component pools [@klein2015].

##1.1.5 Eucalyptus tree species as model for research
Research on *Eucalyptus* trees is ecologically important for Australia as it is the most dominant tree genus [@boland2006forest]. *Eucalyptus* forests are the continentâs most common forest type, covering about three-quarters of Australiaâs native forests (92 million hectares) and occurring in all but the continentâs driest regions [@ASOFR2013]. *Eucalyptus* tree species are also economically important globally as they are commonly cultivated in plantations due to fast growth. Despite the fact that only a few *Eucalyptus* species have natural ranges outside continental Australia [@pryor1981eucalyptus], *Eucalyptus* trees are grown in plantations in over 90 countries [@booth2013eucalypt]. This is because *Eucalyptus* species have been shown to exhibit both adaptive plasticity and genetic specialization to spatial variation in climate [@byrne2013adaptation]. Currently, the global plantation area of eucalypts totals nearly 20 million hectares, accounting for around 15 % of the worldâs total plantation forests [@IUFRO2015]. Consequently, this iconic Australian tree species is an excellent model to investigate strategies of resource allocation in trees facing global climate change.

#1.2  Current Knowledge Gaps

##1.2.1 Resource allocation in trees
The distribution of assimilated C is a primary determinant of plant growth [@friedlingstein1999toward], yet our knowledge of the mechanisms by which allocation is regulated is poor [@poorter2012biomass].  A key issue with drawing generalized conclusions about the plasticity of C allocation in trees is with the inconsistency in terminology used to define C allocation to specific tissue or ecosystem components [@litton2007carbon]. Biomass partitioning should not be confused with the allocation of newly fixed photosynthates to different organs, as the measured biomass at any time point represent the cumulative result of dynamic C allocation over time [@poorter2015does]. This dynamic C allocation includes not only tree parts such as leaves, stems and roots but also respiration, exudation, turnover and transient C storage pools. As C allocation integrates all of these processes, it is extremely difficult using current methods to assess C allocation in whole trees. Disentangling the effects of resource supply on plant C allocation patterns is often assessed across âsnapshotsâ in time, which should be done with caution [@reich2002root]. This is because of plants have developmental shifts in biomass partitioning, independent of resource supply, as they age [@muller2000effect; @poorter2015does].  Additionally, supplies of light and soil resources fluctuate continuously, making equilibrium with C allocation at any âsnapshotâ highly unlikely [@shipley2002balanced].

\
As accurately measuring tree C allocation remains a difficult task, especially belowground, drawing conclusions that are applicable to whole plants or ecosystems remains a challenge. Currently, the representation of C allocation lags behind photosynthesis (*A~n~*) in process-based forest models [@friedlingstein1999toward; @franklin2012modeling; @iversen2014terrestrial] and our understanding of how global change impacts C allocation is incomplete [@litton2007carbon; @warren2012timing]. This knowledge gap of C allocation patterns in trees is of major concern due to the potential for forest ecosystems to sequester C in a changing climate. This deficiency requires more empirical data to derive basic principles that drive patterns of tree C allocation in changing environments. However, this will require novel experiments and approaches to better quantify shifts in C allocation above and belowground in future studies. 

##1.2.2 Coupling of photosynthesis and tree growth
On short timescales, *A~n~* and respiratory losses may not correlate with growth because of tissue C storage pools. On longer timescales, however, they determine net plant C balance and must correlate to growth. This had led to the long standing debate over how strongly plant growth is controlled by either source or sink activity [@sweet1966role; @korner2013growth]. Studies manipulating either source activity (CO~2~ fumigation or defoliation) or sink activity (fruit removal, girdling or low growth temperatures) have not reached consensus when addressing this debate. This uncertainty arises from the difficulty in measuring the balance between C uptake and the fate of assimilated C among pools with long (biomass) or short (carbohydrate storage, respiration, exudation) retention times. When shifts in carbohydrate storage, tissue respiration or turnover rates occur, rates of C assimilation may not correlate with biomass production at a given time point [@rocha2006linking; @litton2007carbon; @gough2008multi]. To assess this balance will likely require integration of empirical and modelling approaches to assess leaf physiological and whole plant responses to manipulations of source-sink activity. To address this knowledge gap, new approaches are needed to test how interactions between source and sink activity affect the fate of assimilate C across different temporal scales. 

##1.2.3 Within canopy resource utilization
Due to the relationships between light, N and leaf photosynthetic capacity, it is commonly assumed that a limited availability of N should be distributed proportional to light availability within tree canopies. Observed canopy distribution of N is often less steep than optimal theory suggests, however, with shade leaves having more N than expected based on average light gradients [@peltoniemi2012co]. Additionally, constraints on water distribution from the soil to the upper canopy may negatively impact the distribution of photosynthetic N to canopy light availability [@niinemets2012optimization; @peltoniemi2012co]. Whether insufficient hydraulic supply results in the observed sub-optimal canopy N gradients has yet to be empirically tested. Assessing leaf C gain as a function of light availability is also made difficult by frequent light fluctuations within a canopy, via sunflecks. Sunflecks cause temporal variation in PPFD that is not taken into account when considering what is optimal for a plant in terms of distributing resources along a gradient of light availability.

\
Leaves have been proposed to exhibit optimal physiological behavior in order to efficiently utilize and transport resources to maximize *A~n~* [@thornley1972model]. In trees, leaf physiology often focuses on full sun leaves and relationships between leaf physiological behavior and the availability of N, water and light between sun and shade leaves requires further attention. For example, g~s~ has been hypothesized to be distributed within a canopy to utilize supplies of light, N and water to maximize *A~n~* [@peltoniemi2012co]. In shade leaves, stomata might be expected to be more closed to efficiently use water with generally low *A~n~*. To date, however, no clear picture has emerged on the relationship between g~s~ and *A~n~* within canopies [see @jifon2003moderate; @tissue2006spatial; @sellin2010variation]. As mesophyll conductance (g~m~) also limits *A~n~*, complex relationships may exist between canopy light gradients, leaf N and g~m~. Unfortunately, a scarcity of values for g~m~ within tree canopies [see @lloyd1992low; @warren2003transfer; @piel2002effect; @warren2007internal] hinders our ability to relate individual leaf physiological behavior to optimal canopy C uptake. As the CO~2~ drawdown from the atmosphere to the site of carboxylation includes g~s~ and g~m~, relationships between *A~n~* with light availability, N and water within canopies will require the integration of both physiological parameters in future experiments.

#1.3  Thesis Objectives
The overall research goal is to evaluate how trees adjust their growth and physiology to maximize resource uptake and C gain. Specifically, this PhD research addresses knowledge gaps of how tissue C allocation, source and sink regulation and resource distribution affect the coordination between *A~n~* and whole tree growth. In order to investigate key mechanisms that drive patterns in resource allocation in trees this research was carried out across multiples scales, from leaf isotope discrimination across the photosynthetic CO~2~ flux pathway to tissue specific biomass partitioning to total belowground C allocation. Understanding how resource allocation is correlated with individual leaf physiological behavior within tree canopies is crucial in accurately determining the capacity for whole canopy C assimilation, which is the essential resource for tree growth.  Aspects of this research use manipulations of key global change factors, including elevated CO~2~, warming and drought to investigate the plasticity of observed physiological and growth responses to future climate scenarios. An improved understanding of how C is allocated within trees will supply much needed empirical data for process-based forest models where C allocation is currently poorly represented. 

\
This research focuses on two Australian tree species, *Eucalyptus tereticornis* and *Eucalyptus saligna*, which have important roles in both native forests ecosystems and as commercial plantation timber. *Eucalyptus tereticornis* is part of the critically endangered Cumberland Plain ecological community and *Eucalyptus saligna* is part of the critically endangered Blue Gum High Forest ecological community, with both communities having fragmented geographic distributions in the Sydney Basin bioregion [@hughes2011web]. Both of these species are part of the âbig nineâ *Eucalyptus* species group which accounts for more than 90 % of planted *Eucalyptus* forests worldwide [@stanturf2013eucalyptus]. As a result, the core findings of this PhD research have both conservation and commercial applications in addressing the productivity of these two important tree species in the face of global climate change. For example, considerable uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of CO~2~ fertilization on this continent as much of the vegetation is already under nutrient and/or water limitation [@hughes2003climate]. 

\
This research was conducted using the state of the art Whole Tree Chamber experiment as well as a novel field-based seedlings container study at Western Sydney University. Using the two *Eucalyptus* tree species, fundamental principles of common optimization theories were tested at several tree growth stages. Leaf based data were combined with tissue biomass production and canopy C fluxes to develop a better understanding of how resources are allocated to optimize whole tree growth. Empirical data were also integrated with a seedling growth model to test how resource limitation impacts the coordination between A and growth. Specifically, this thesis aimed to address current knowledge gaps by answering the following main questions:

\
1.	**Where does the carbon go?** 
\
How will biomass partitioning and carbon allocation in *Eucalyptus* trees be affected by global climate change and belowground resource limitation?

\
2.**When do photosynthesis and growth not add up?**
\
What do mass balance approaches reveal about the coordination of growth and photosynthesis at different temporal scales?

\
3.	**Are whole canopies optimized for carbon gain?**
\
How does resource availability within *Eucalyptus* tree canopies interact with dynamic physiology of sun and shade leaves to maximize canopy carbon gain?

#1.4  Thesis Outline

**Chapter 2** was designed to address thesis questions 1 & 2 by manipulating belowground sink strength in *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings, via a range of container sizes, in a novel field-based experimental design. The effects of belowground resource limitation were then used to investigate patterns in biomass partitioning, leaf gas exchange and growth between container treatments and field grown seedlings. Empirically measured gas exchange parameters were then used to model daily C gain for each seedling to test the coordination between the reduction in *A~n~* and biomass production of seedlings with soil volume restriction. The sensitivity of this model to different C allocation scenarios was used to speculate possible fates of photosynthetic C not accounted for in the default model. Results of this study are then used to address the ongoing debate over source or sink controls of *A~n~* and growth. The flexibility of this mass balance modelling approach is used to highlight the importance of quantifying C allocation when evaluating the impacts of resource limitation on tree seedling growth.

\
**Chapter 3** addressed thesis question 3 by combining leaf gas exchange with online C isotope discrimination to measure the responses of sun and shade leaf physiology to light availability. The distribution of leaf N and leaf hydraulic conductance within *Eucalyptus tereticornis* canopies where examined to test if the resources required for *A~n~* were preferentially invested into sun leaves, as predicted by standard optimal theory, to maximize whole canopy C gain. The physiological capacity of shade leaves to respond to increases in light availability was quantified to determine if shade leaves âlie in waitâ for sunflecks. Trees were grown in climate controlled WTCs under ambient and elevated air (+3&deg;C) temperature treatments to test the impacts of future climate warming on each of these processes. Rarely have relationships between *A~n~* and both g~s~ and g~m~ been quantified within tree canopies, thus results from this experiment are used to reveal potential new mechanisms underpinning leaf gas exchange responses to light. Unexpected decreases in water-use efficiency in shade leaves where related to the capacity of inner canopy leaves to rapidly utilize sunflecks. Empirical data from this experiment improves our ability to predict whole canopy C gain by prioritizing both sun and shade leaf physiology, which may be optimized differently.

\
**Chapter 4** addresses thesis questions 1 & 2 by quantifying high resolution net canopy photosynthesis measurements and C allocation in *Eucalyptus saligna* trees grown under interacting drought and elevated CO~2~ treatments. The unique WTC experimental design measures cumulative net aboveground C fluxes which were compared to canopy leaf area and tree biomass production. A novel framework was also applied to calculate a more reliable estimate of the sensitivity of TBCA to global climate change. I then evaluated how interacting climate change factors impacted C allocation to above and belowground pools through time. Results from this experiment emphasize the need to correctly define individual aspects of tree C allocation and separate impacts on measured biomass from other components of C allocation when evaluating tree growth responses. As empirical measurements of C allocation are difficult to obtain, especially with belowground processes, these results provide much needed empirical data to validate process-based model where C allocation is represented. 

\
**Chapter 5** presents the synthesis and outlook of the major findings in my PhD research as they relate to each main thesis question. First, shifts in C allocation likely occurred as these two *Eucalyptus* species were impacted by changing environments, even though biomass partitioning of harvested trees remained relatively conserved. Combined results from Chapters 2 & 4 are used to discuss how observed responses of biomass partitioning and C allocation correspond to prevailing theory and how these mass balance approaches have improved our understanding of the investment of photosynthetic C in trees. Second, I show that coupling between total C gain and tree growth can be disrupted over shorter experimental time frames, while over longer time scales they are strongly correlated as a function of leaf area. Results from Chapter 2 use empirical data and modelling approaches to address the current debate over source and sink control over seedling growth, while Chapter 4 is used to discussed how unique measurements of net canopy photosynthesis correlate to tree productivity under future climate scenarios. Last, I show that sun and shade leaves exhibit different physiological behavior in order to utilize differential availability of external resources within *Eucalyptus tereticornis* canopies. Results from Chapter 3 are used to show that shade leaf physiology is likely optimized differently from sun leaves in order to respond to sunflecks, which has important consequence for current theories regarding how resources are allocated to optimize canopy C gain.

# 1.5 Reproducible Reseach
Science is driven by data, yet it is a challenge to ensure that reported experimental data are appropriately described, standardized, archived and openly available [@hanson2011making]. Reproducibility serves as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible, which should include making available the data and the computer code used to analyze the data [@peng2011reproducible]. Not only does producing reproducible research increase the reliability and credibility of one's findings, but it encourages the engagement of the scientific community to advance new research ideas. Every aspect of this PhD research attempts to adhere to these key principles of reproducibility. Raw data and code for each experimental chapter are located in an easily accessible online repository. This entire thesis is also produced as an integrated document of text and code, and is made available to allow for open access. As a result, all necessary information required to reproduce this thesis, in it's entirety, are located in repositories at https://github.com/CourtneyCampany.

# 5.1 Synthesis
It has long been recognized that resources limit plant growth in different environments, at different life stages and individual plant processes are limited by different resources [@bazzaz2000reproductive]. Consequently, a quantitative understanding of how plants gain and allocate resources is necessary to predict their success in any environment [@mooney1972carbon]. In this thesis work, resources allocated for growth in *Eucalyptus* tree species are classified into two distinct groups. The first group consists of environmental plant resources that are captured, distributed and utilized to drive rates of A and thus tree C gain. These C assimilates comprise the second group, which are the essential internal resource required to fuel tissue growth, storage and respiration. These two resource group are inextricably linked and interact to define plant growth across spatial and temporal scales. For example, the C expended in acquiring N makes up a significant fraction of the total energy a plant consumes, while leaf N investment constrains photosynthetic capacity [@chapin1987plant]. In trees, rates of A will then depend on the photosynthetic light response of individual leaves and the energetic trade-offs of gas exchange related to transpiration and water supply [@givnish1988adaptation].

\
The research presented in this thesis was designed to investigate resource allocation in trees at individual tissue and whole plant scales using model *Eucalyptus* species. I sought to address theories of plant functional balance by testing biomass partitioning in seedlings and trees undergoing various environmental manipulations. As observed biomass production may not necessarily reveal shifts in plant functional responses, I evaluated the sensitivity of the allocation of photosynthate above and belowground across different temporal scales. Using mass balance approaches I then tested the coordination between growth an net leaf photosynthesis (*A~n~*), using leaf gas exchange parameters in seedlings and measurements of net canopy C gain in trees. To help bridge the knowledge gap between leaf and canopy C gain I investigated the distribution of soil resources as a function of light availability within canopies and the effect this has on individual leaf physiology. By utilizing novel experimental approaches, evidence from this work improves our understanding of functional processes that determine the net C uptake of trees and then how this assimilated C is used to fuel growth. The contribution of this body of work provides fundamental evidence underlying resource allocation in ecologically and commercially important Eucalyptus tree species.

###5.1.1 Where does the carbon go?
This thesis question arises from large uncertainties that remain regarding fundamental processes which affect terrestrial C cycling.  The question âWhere does the carbon go?â arises from the need to track the fate of C from canopy *A~n~* to determine the contribution of forests ecosystems to C cycling [@litton2007carbon]. Currently, empirical data regarding this topic are critical to the development of C allocation in forest models and subsequent predictions of global C balance under climate change [@franklin2012modeling]. Growth responses during early phases of trees establishment (seedlings or young trees) to changes in soil resource availability or climate change factors will likely depend on the ability to maintain positive C balance between growth, respiration and storage. Consequently, understanding environmentally driven shifts in C allocation in young *Eucalyptus* trees will be crucial to manage their fitness in fragile native ecosystems and their productivity in terms of timber production and quality in agroforestry systems.

\
First, I examined patterns in biomass partitioning of *E.tereticornis* seedlings with belowground resource limitation (Chapter 1) and with *E.saligna* trees exposed to eC~a~ and drought treatments (Chapter 2).  Across these studies, partitioning of harvested biomass appeared to follow allometric trajectories related to overall plant size, regardless of treatment manipulation. Partitioning to roots, leaves and stems in *E.tereticornis* seedlings was conserved across a large variation in seedling biomass with and without soil volume restriction (15-175 g). During this early growth stage, these results infer that growth inhibition from reduced belowground sink strength did not elicit a functional partitioning response. With much larger 2 year old *E.Saligna* trees, grown in WTCs, differences in partitioning to stem biomass were detected between aC~a~ and eC~a~ treatments.  These patterns were also attributed to size dependent relationship associated with ontogeny [see @poorter2015does], rather than a functional tree response to eC~a~.

\
Combined results from these two experiments argue against traditional views of plant functional balance in the context of observed biomass production. These theories posit that plants will âoptimally forageâ for the most limiting resource, thus shifts in biomass partitioning should occur. However, adaptive plant responses can extend beyond biomass production at any given âsnapshotâ in time.  This makes tracking C allocation to processes other than observed biomass just as important in assessing growth responses. Here, empirical and modelling evidence from Chapters 2 & 4 reveal that detection in shifts of tissue C allocation were necessary to interpret whole tree response to environmental manipulations. For *E.tereticornis* seedlings, modelling results infer that increases in C allocation to pools other than biomass were required to fully explain the effects of soil volume restriction on seedling growth. For *E.saligna* trees, increased leaf C demand under eC~a~ treatments resulted in higher C allocation to leaves without altering observed leaf biomass production. Overall, the ability to distinguish biomass production from C allocation across tissues reveals that alternate explanations are likely need to interpret the degree in which trees strive to maintain functional balance.

Alternatively, shifts in tissue morphology, metabolism or turnover to alter resource uptake of loss [@reich2002root], increased root exudation to alleviate resource limitation [@phillips2011enhanced] or increased C allocation to storage [@sala2012carbon ; @dietze2014nonstructural] may be used to balance trade-offs between tissue sink strength, resource availability and source C supply. Partial evidence for these ânon-biomassâ responses were evident in *E.tereticornis* seedlings during this thesis research.  Increases in specific root length were detected in some, but not all, of seedlings with soil volume restriction. Modelling results also revealed that increases in tissue respiration rates were a possible mechanism to account for the oversupply of C not allocated to biomass. Increases in leaf carbohydrate storage were correlated with reduced belowground sink strength in these seedlings, and it is possible that C storage could also have increased in other tissues. Root exudation may have increased in response to adverse poor quality soil conditions with *E.tereticornis* seedlings in containers or in *E.saligna* trees under eC~a~ to meet resource demand, but was not explicitly measured.

\
The ability to compare biomass partitioning with aspects of C allocation across multiple experiments highlights how partial accounting of C may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding adaptive plant responses to changing environments. Overall, these results reveal why studies using only biomass partitioning to assess functional balance or allometric based theories have mixed results.  Additionally, shifts in above but not belowground C allocation *E.saligna* trees disagrees with the regularity of enhancement of belowground processes in other trees species under eC~a~ [see @palmroth2006aboveground; @iversen2014terrestrial]. Shipley et al. [-@shipley2002balanced] states that it is more appropriate to say that plants shift biomass allocation to reduce imbalances between leaf source activity and tissue resource acquisition. Collectively, results from this research tend to agree with this conclusion, with the caveat that the concept of allocation must be extended to include fates of C other than measured biomass. Consequently, we agree with Poorter et al. [-@poorter2012biomass] that understanding C allocation above and belowground requires a better understanding of the interactions between tissue source and sink activity at any time point. In order to fully understand the impact environmental change has on forest productivity approaches to quantify patterns in C allocation must be prioritized in future studies.

###5.1.2 When do photosynthesis and growth not add up?

This thesis question addresses the debate over how strongly plant growth is controlled by either source or sink activity, which may disrupt the coordination between A and growth at different temporal scales. Carbon assimilate is first partitioned to provide sufficient sucrose for the immediate demands of the plant during the day, and sufficient starch to meet âanticipatedâ demands during the following night [@smith2007coordination]. The C demands for each tissue, referred to as tissue C sinks, determine the C budget for the entire plant and regulate C allocation. Despite competition among highly integrated C sinks, woody plants also maintain storage carbohydrate pools as C reserves [@kozlowski1992carbohydrate]. Understanding the coordination between plant growth and *A~n~* thus requires mass balance approaches to quantify the fractions of C supply allocated to growth, storage and respiration of different organs. Reductions in tissue sink strength have been shown to signal the down regulation of *A~n~*, which can led to increased starch synthesis for storage [@sage1994acclimation; @kitao2007interaction]. This had led to support for the argument that increased shifts to C storage will compete with C available for plant growth [@chapin1990ecology], which may then disrupt the coordination between *A~n~* and growth.

\
To address this thesis question the belowground sink strength of *E.tereticornis* seedlings was manipulated, through container size treatments, to test the effects of sink limitation on *A~n~* and leaf TNC production (Chapter 1). Empirical results and modelling approaches were combined to test the coordination of A and growth of seedlings with and without soil volume limitation over 120 days. First, apparent reductions in belowground sink strength negatively impacted leaf N content and photosynthetic capacity, while leaf starch increased. These results support other findings where manipulation of tissue C sinks leads to carbohydrate accumulation and photosynthetic down regulation [@hoch2002altitudinal; @iglesias2002regulation; @equiza2006photosynthetic; @urban2007girdling; @haouari2013fruit]. Second, large reductions of harvested biomass in seedlings with soil volume limitation initially suggested that observed reductions in *A~n~* and growth were tightly linked.  As previously shown in thesis question 1, however, inadequate accounting of C allocation could lead to premature conclusions regarding this linkage. Importantly, using measured reductions in *A~n~* with a mass balance seedling growth model largely over-predicted biomass production from observed results. These findings reveal that not only can *A~n~* and growth not add up when belowground sink strength changes but other mechanisms, beyond *A~n~* and carbohydrate accumulation, must now be explored to explain growth responses.

\
At long enough time scales, however, A and respiratory losses together determine net C balance and must be coordinated to plant growth. Consequently, we need to evaluate if trade-offs between storage and growth actually matter for long term C balance of trees [@palacio2014does]. The difficulty in measuring total canopy C uptake and the allocation of this assimilate to different tissue sinks currently impedes the ability to quantify whole tree C balance through time. Combining allometric approaches to estimate growth with seasonal variation in carbohydrates of stem wood and roots, Genet et al. [-@genet2010age] found contrasting results with the C balance between storage and growth across a chronosequence of stand age. Utilizing the novel WTC experimental design, I sought to address this knowledge gap by applying a simple mass balance approach with *E.saligna* trees (Chapter 4). Empirical measurements of net cumulative C uptake were correlated with whole tree C mass, which integrates the total allocation of C to growth and storage over an 11 month period.  This simplified method allows for the coordination of *A~n~* and growth to be tested without issues in accounting for C retention in tissues through time [@litton2007carbon]. During this time period, total tree C mass was strongly correlated to net canopy photosynthetic C gain across a 2.5 fold range in tree size. If the C balance between growth and storage was disrupted by eC~a~ or drought in these trees, it did not affect the overall coordination between C supply and growth over ~1 yr. Overall, results from Chapters 2 & 4 highlight how utilization of C mass balance improves our ability to explore mechanisms in which source and sink activity feedback to tree growth. Although I show that answers to the debate regarding the coordination of allocation of C to storage and growth requires a deeper understanding C allocation, it appears that whole canopy assimilation and tree growth are tightly coordinated over long periods.

###5.1.3. Are whole canopies optimized for carbon gain?

Scaling from single leaf photosynthetic performance to net canopy assimilation is difficult because of concomitant variations in environment and foliage physiology and structure [@niinemets2009packing]. The ability to estimate whole canopy C gain involves knowledge of the non-linear responses of A to light between shaded and sunlit leaves [@de1997simple; @linderson2012up], which requires the ability to differentiate  light energy utilization, environmental resource distribution, physiological behavior and CO~2~ fluxes  within tree canopies [@dai2004two; @peltoniemi2012co; @niinemets2012optimization]. Theory suggests that interactions between traits which influence *A~n~* and transpiration should interact to determine optimal patterns of behavior for whole plant C gain [@givnish1988adaptation].  Theories of optimal resource allocation and leaf physiological behavior have been developed [@cowan1977stomatal; @medlyn2011reconciling; @peltoniemi2012co] and subsequently tested [@wright2003least; @heroult2013optimal; @prentice2014balancing; @lin2015optimal] across different ecosystems and plant functional types. This thesis question arises because optimal leaf physiology is commonly assessed for seedlings or âfull sunâ leaves, thus our understanding of how resource allocation and individual leaf physiology interact to maximize net canopy C uptake is surprisingly limited. Seeking answers to ecological questions such as âWhere does the carbon go?â and âWhen do photosynthesis and growth not add up?â first requires an understanding of how leaves in different light environments utilize resources to maximize canopy C gain.

\
Theories of leaf economic strategies are often used to describe the patterns in which resources are distributed in order for plants to optimize *A~n~* [@wright2003least].  In this economic framework, I first evaluated how N and water supply were distributed in relation to *A~n~* within *Eucalyptus tereticornis* tree canopies (Chapter 3). Leaf N and photosynthetic capacity were found to be highest in full sun leaves, which agree with conventional theory that resources for A should be preferentially invested relative to light availability. Overall, higher measured rates of *A~n~* in full sun leaves compared to shade leaves implies that N resources were invested to maximize source activity in upper canopy full sun leaves. The distribution of leaf hydraulic conductance, however, was not correlated with canopy N gradients or *A~n~* between sun and shade leaves. It was therefore necessary to further investigate relationships between leaf physiology, carbon uptake and water-use efficiency (WUE) across leaf types.

\
It has been previously hypothesized that stomatal conductance (g~s~) should be distributed within a canopy to utilize supplies of light, N and water to maximize *A~n~* [@peltoniemi2012co]. Under ambient light conditions g~s~ was consistently higher in shade leaves despite lower rates of *A~n~*. The resultant inefficient water use in shade leaves suggests that stomatal behavior may be optimized differently within tree canopies. Pearcy and Way [-@pearcy2012two] theorize that shade leaves may have mechanisms to enhance sunfleck use, including changes in induction through enzyme regulation or stomatal opening. Our data agree with Tausz et al. [-@tausz2005dynamic] that sustaining higher g~s~ may be a strategy to efficiently utilize sunflecks through reduced stomatal response time. This strategy, however, does not guarantee increased leaf C uptake as mesophyll conductance (g~m~) may  still limit *A~n~*.  Under high light conditions g~m~ and *A~n~* responded rapidly in shade leaves, leading to leaf C gain of greater magnitude than sun leaves. Rarely have relationships between *A~n~* and both g~s~ and g~m~ been quantified within tree canopies, thus I reveal a possible new mechanism of how leaf physiological behavior responds to light. These findings show that resources may also be distributed within a canopy to utilize sunflecks and that both CO~2~ resistance pathways must be accounted for when evaluating leaf behavior to optimize canopy C gain.

###5.2 Conclusions
The diversity and non-linearity of plant ecophysiological processes poses challenges in predicting and analyzing structure and function of ecological systems [@field1983allocating]. These processes include complex strategies in ways plant uptake, distribute and utilize resources for growth in fluctuating environments. I examined how these resources, in the context of external environmental resources and new C assimilate, are allocated to fuel growth in both current and future climate conditions. This thesis work demonstrates that quantifying the underlying processes defining tree growth requires knowledge of the feedbacks between leaf source activity and tissue sink strength, which are both constrained by resource availability.  When addressing the fates of assimilated C across multiple experiments it was determined that biomass partitioning patterns did not support theories of âoptimal foragingâ when faced with eC~a~, drought, or belowground resource limitation. If trees strive to maintain functional balance, this collective research indicates that quantifying shifts in C allocation beyond biomass production are the key to unraveling adaptive responses. Additionally, I show how measuring shifts in C allocation are now necessary to gain new perspective regarding sink and source controls of growth and *A~n~*. This thesis research advocates for continued use of C mass balance approaches which include empirically measured or accurately modeled whole plant net C uptake. As this research presents new strategies in which tree canopies are optimized for C gain, further investigation of resource allocation and leaf physiological behavior within canopies should be prioritized to advance predictions of tree C gain. It will be the ability to quantify cumulative plant C gain through time combined with continued exploration of the fate of assimilated C that will allow future research to elucidate plant responses to environmental change beyond âsnapshotsâ in time.

###5.2.1 *Eucalyptus* forests
A goal of this thesis was to contribute to the knowledge of the physiological ecology of *Eucalyptus* tree species to aid in understanding the susceptibility of threatened native forest ecosystems and the productivity of commercially important tree species to future climate change. First, findings related to the response of shade leaf physiology to dynamic light environments contributes to the overall understanding of canopy C gain in *Eucalyptus* trees. This utilization of sunflecks may play a critical role in productivity of *Eucalyptus* open-forests, specifically dry sclerophyll forests, in Australian ecosystems. Canopy cover in these open forest types likely allow for frequent sunflecks of high intensity at varying lengths.  Additionally, many *Eucalyptus* species are characterized by steep leaf angles which can alter light penetrating the canopy, leaf physiology, radiation loads and C gain [@cowan1981coping; @king1997functional; @james2000leaf; @falster2003leaf ]. Integration of these research findings with the functional role of leaf orientation may explain how *Eucalyptus* trees maintain positive C and energy balance in resource poor ecosystems and may be applicable to improve commercial stand productivity through thinning or pruning.

\
Second, aspects of leaf physiology and C allocation in these *Eucalyptus* trees species were less sensitivity to manipulations of warming, eC~a~ and drought than hypothesized. *Eucalyptus* trees are often characterized as being highly adaptable in order to cope with Australiaâs prevailing climate and soils. It is possible that this adaptability plays a role in the observed stability of ecophysiological processes across the duration of these experiments (months to years). Consequently, warming treatments and simulated droughts may not have been of great enough magnitude to elicit functional plant response within experimental time frames. However, these results should by no means be used to conclude that Australian forest ecosystems are overly resilient to future climate regimes.  Future climate scenarios predict increased frequency of extreme daily temperatures, heat waves, and limited water resources due to higher temperature and decreased rainfall in Australia [@ipcc2014]. Importantly, this research emphasizes that further empirical data quantifying C allocation to specific tissue, flux and ecosystem pools are critical in uncovering the drivers of tree responses to climate. Continued investigation of the cumulative impacts of eC~a~, warming and drought on *Eucalyptus* tree growth and fitness, such as the WTC experiments, will develop our ability to predict âtipping pointsâ for Australian forest ecosystems under future climate change.

# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Interpreting limitations to plant growth requires understanding of the balance between carbon (C) source and sink activity. This study used manipulations of soil volume to test how growth is coupled to physiology, C allocation, and sink activity in *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings. We grew individual seedlings in a large range of container sizes and planted containers flush to the soil alongside naturally sown (free) seedlings. We developed a seedling growth model that utilized leaf photosynthesis rates (*A~n~*) to allocate daily C uptake towards mass growth of stems, leaves and roots. Reduced soil volume was expected to induce rapid negative effects on growth and physiology compared to free seedlings. It was hypothesized that the soil volume effect would be largest in the smallest containers, negatively impacting mass partitioning belowground. An accumulation of leaf non-structural carbohydrates, resulting from reduced belowground sink strength, was expected to correlate to reductions in photosynthetic capacity. We observed a negative effect of container volume on aboveground growth soon after the experiment started. Although growth was consistently different across soil volumes, dry mass partitioning to leaves, stems and roots was unchanged after 120 days. Photosynthetic capacity was significantly reduced in containers compared to free seedlings, and was related to both leaf nitrogen content and starch accumulation. We then asked whether the observed reductions in *A~n~* explained the observed differences in seedling biomass. We found that although belowground sink limitation resulted in down regulation of *A~n~*, these reductions were not large enough to explain observed growth responses. Thus, as *A~n~* and growth were not tightly coordinated, excess photosynthetic C not attributed to biomass resulted in seedlings with soil volume restriction. These results highlight the need to further utilize mass balance approaches when evaluating plant C allocation and confirms that important feedbacks exist between belowground sink strength and leaf C uptake.

# Introduction

Understanding plant growth and its relationship to C assimilation requires knowledge of the mass balance that must be achieved between C uptake and subsequent allocation to growth, storage, and respiration. As woody plants have highly integrated systems of competing carbohydrate sinks [@kozlowski1992carbohydrate], growth should principally depend on the allocation of photosynthate among different tissues and organs. At long enough time scales leaf photosynthesis (*A~n~*) and respiratory losses together determine net C balance and will correlate to plant growth. At shorter temporal scales, however, growth can instead be mediated by tissue C storage pools. This has led to the current debate on how strongly plant growth is controlled by either source or sink activity. Consequently, plant growth cannot always be simply determined by the photosynthesis rate, making it complex to understand and challenging to model [@fourcaud2008plant]. Despite a wealth of studies, large uncertainties still remain regarding the coordination of C supply and growth of woody species.

\
In woody species, the coordination of *A~n~* and growth has been studied with manipulations of C source activity. Examples included elevated CO~2~ experiments, for example FACE [reviewed in @ainsworth2005have], and partial defoliation experiments. Elevated CO~2~ has been shown to increase *A~n~* [@drake1997more; @ainsworth2007response] and across four FACE experiments this resulted in a stimulation of 23 % in forest biomass production [@norby2005forest]. Evidence from a wide range of elevated CO~2~ experiments, however, also reveals that even with an average photosynthetic enhancement of over 30 %, the biomass growth rate only increases by around 10 % [@kirschbaum2011does]. In partial defoliation experiments, increases in *A~n~* of the remaining foliage are commonly shown, yet are attributed to various mechanisms, including reduction in end product inhibition [@iglesias2002regulation; @zhou2003changes; @handa2005test], enhanced biochemical activity [@ovaska1993b;@layne1995end], increased stomatal conductance [@layne1995end], enhanced leaf nutrient status [@turnbull2007increased] and regulatory sugar signaling [@eyles2013whole]. However, increases in *A~n~* in defoliation experiments did not always produce increased growth due to reductions in meristem sink strength [@palacio2012fast], C limitation to mycorrhizal colonization [@markkola2004defoliation], or an overall decrease in whole plant C gain [@ovaska1993a]. These manipulations of C source activity expose unresolved issues with how changes in *A~n~* do not always infer similar responses in growth.

\
Alternatively, manipulating plant tissue C sinks is often used to investigate the correlation of *A~n~* and growth. This is because metabolic signaling networks, relaying information on C and N status of different tissues, can regulate photosynthetic activity [@paul2001sink]. If sink inhibition of *A~n~* occurs, a close coordination between declines in *A* and growth should be expected. Whether photosynthetic down regulation is evident in woody species has been tested through fruit removal, phloem girdling and low temperatures at high elevations. In these studies, down regulation of *A* was frequently correlated to carbohydrate accumulation resulting from reduced tissue sink strength  [@iglesias2002regulation;@hoch2002altitudinal; @urban2007girdling; @haouari2013fruit]. However, reductions in *A~n~* were also attributed to biochemical limitations prior to carbohydrate accumulation [@nebauer2011photosynthesis], irreversible photo-oxidative damage [@duan2008photosynthetic] and stomatal limitation [@li2005photosynthesis]. These mixed results are not surprising as we still know little about the balance between assimilation, storage and growth across temporal scales in plants [@smith2007coordination]. As these manipulations likely impact source as well as sink activity simultaneously, affect water transport, are very extreme, or are specific to the occurrence of large fruiting sinks, they tell us little about source-sink coordination in typical growing conditions for woody species.

\
An alternative experimental approach is to reduce belowground C sink strength in tree seedlings by manipulating rooting volume, by varying the container size [@arp1991effects; @nesmith1998effect; @poorter2012pot]. Possible advantages of this approach are that it allows a large range of treatment levels, can be easily compared to naturally planted seedlings and may mimic natural conditions as seedlings compete for space or reach bedrock. Seedlings undergo many physiological and morphological changes in response to rooting volume, including biomass partitioning, *A~n~*, water relations, nutrient uptake and respiration [@nesmith1998effect;@poorter2012pot and references therein]. Inadequate rooting volume may decrease C sink strength by progressively restricting root growth in growing plants [@thomas1991root].  Container size studies frequently exhibit photosynthetic down-regulation, likely as a result of sink limitation [@arp1991effects; @mcconnaughay1991physical; @gunderson1994photosynthetic; @sage1994acclimation; @maina2002intra; @ronchi2006growth]. A meta-analysis by Poorter et al. [-@poorter2012pot] concluded that *A~n~* is the process likely to be the strongest affected by pot size and may best explain the effects on biomass seen in the large number of studies where containers are used. This conclusion arises because plants grown in small containers are shown to accumulate leaf starch while having lower C exchange and assimilate export rates [@robbins1988effect]. However, evidence in support for a trade-off between C storage and growth in trees is, to date, inconclusive [@palacio2014does]. Based on these previous studies, using container size as a sink-strength manipulation can be used to empirically test the extent to which growth and *A~n~* are coordinated.

\
This study utilizes a novel field design to investigate the coordination between growth and *A~n~* in *Eucalyptus tereticornis* Sm. seedlings, by manipulating container size and thus rooting volume. Seedlings were maintained under well watered conditions in order to isolate the effect of restricted soil volume. We used freely-rooted seedlings as a control for the container size treatments. Empirical results were combined with a simple plant growth model to simulate seedling growth with a C mass balance approach, which was then compared to observed harvested seedling mass. The model used whole-plant C gain, scaled from instantaneous rates of leaf *A~n~*, to quantify seedling dry mass production over the 120 day experiment.

\
Our hypotheses were as follows:
\
1). The manipulations of container size were expected to induce a belowground sink limitation compared to free seedlings. We hypothesized that declines in seedling growth would be largest in the smallest containers.

2). As the finite pool of rooting volume and soil nutrients will decline faster in trees growing in small containers, we expected reductions in partitioning to fine root mass relative to tree size with decreasing container size.

3). Reduced sink strength was expected to lead to accumulation of leaf non-structural carbohydrates, and a resulting down regulation of A. We therefore expected a correlation between carbohydrate accumulation and photosynthetic capacity as a function of soil volume.

4). Last, observed seedling mass was expected to correspond to growth model mass predicted from a simple C balance model taking into account measured rates of photosynthesis.


# Materials and Methods

## Experimental design
This experiment was located at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment site in Richmond, NSW, Australia. Plots were located in an open cover paddock that was converted from native pasture grasses. Top soils at this site are an alluvial formation of low-fertility sandy loam soils (380 and 108 mg kg^-1^ total N and phosphorus respectively) with low organic matter (0.7 %) and low water holding capacity. At this site a soil hard layer exists at ~1.0 m with a transition to heavy clay soils. The climate for the region is classified as sub-humid temperate. 

\
*Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings, 20 weeks old and approximately 40 cm tall in tube stock, were chosen from a single local Cumberland plain cohort. Six additional seedlings were harvested before planting to measure initial leaf area and dry mass of leaves, stems and roots.Previous pot experiments have confirmed that species with tap roots (similar to *E. tereticornis*) use the center of the container as the medium for thick roots leaving the periphery of the soil as the most active sites for fine root proliferation [@biran1980a; @biran1980b]. By using a species with tap root growth and manipulations of container length rather than width, we believed that a more realistic test of growth inhibition through constrained soil volume would be achieved. 

\
Six container volumes were used ranging from 5 L to 35 L, with a 22.5 cm diameter, and lengths ranging from 15 to 100 cm. Containers were constructed of PVC pipe and were filled with local top soil (described above). Soil in each container was packed to achieve a target soil bulk density that matched local soil conditions of 1.7 g cm^-3^. A Imidacloprid (BAYER CropScience) insecticide tablet was planted 5 cm below the roots of each seedling. Containers were planted flush with the soil surface inside metal sleeves, designed to minimize excess air space between the container and outside soil while also allowing for container removal. This allowed for soil temperatures in containers to reflect conditions of naturally planted ('free') seedlings. Each experimental block (n=7) contained a complete replicate set of six container volumes as well as one free seedling, with 1 m^2^ spacing. For each free seedling, used as the control, a 1 m^2^ subplot was excavated to the hard layer and replaced with the same soil used in each container. A border of root exclusion material was buried 0.25 m deep and extended 0.25 m above the ground surface around each subplot to exclude local vegetation.

\
Plants were watered weekly or when needed to maintain soil moisture at field capacity (13-15 %). Drain systems were built into each pot to prevent pooling of water throughout the experiment. Pooling of water could lead to an anaerobic environment around the root that could hinder the uptake of water through reduced root conductance [@poorter2009causes], an undesired experimental artifact. A collection compartment in the bottom of containers, containing gravel covered by root exclusion mesh, was used to collect excess water for 20, 25, and 35 l containers. Plastic tubing (6 mm diameter) was inset into the gravel layer and extended through the top of the container. A lysimeter pump was then used to suction excess water, through the tubing, as needed. For small containers (5, 10, and 15 L) a simple bottom plug was used to drain excess water from the gravel compartment. Each containers was inspected after every rainfall event to determine if pooling had occurred.

## Growth and morphology metrics
Seedlings were planted in summer (January 21^st^ 2013) and stem height, diameter at 15 cm and leaf count were measured weekly thereafter. Once the growth rate of individual plants had significantly declined a full biomass harvest was completed and the experiment ended (May 21^st^ 2013). Dry mass of leaves, stems, roots and total leaf area (LI-3100C Area Meter; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) were measured for each seedling. Mean individual leaf area for each harvested seedling was calculated by dividing total measured leaf area by total leaf count of only fully expanded leaves. Mean individual leaf area was then used to interpolate total seedling leaf area through time with weekly leaf counts. Root mass was collected by removing the roots system and passing soil from each container through a 1 mm sieve, washing, separating into fine and coarse roots (<2 mm and >2 mm diameter, respectively) and then drying to a constant mass. Roots of seedlings in containers were not considered pot bound, as clusters of roots along the soil-container interface were not observed. Roots from the free seedlings were collected by excavating each 1 m^2^ subplot to the hard layer and keeping only roots within the subplot. For each seedling, a sub-sample of washed fine roots was analyzed for root length using WhinoRhizo software (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, QC, Canada). Specific root length (SRL) is reported as the root length divided by the dry mass of each sub-sample (m g^-1^). Fine root length density (FRLD) for seedlings in containers is reported as the total fine root length divided by the volume of each container (m dm^-3^). 

## Photosynthetic parameters
Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed fortnightly at saturating light (A~sat~) and saturating light and [CO~2~] (A~max~) on new fully expanded leaves. Measurements were initiated only after sufficient new leaf growth occurred (March 05^th^, 2013), approximately 6 weeks following planting, and continued until the biomass harvest. Leaf level gas exchange was measured with a standard leaf chamber (2 x 3 cm) equipped with blue-red light emitting diodes using a portable gas exchange system (LI-6400, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). A~sat~ measurements were made at PPFD of 1800 $\mu$mol m^-1^ s^-1^ and [CO~2~] of 400 $\mu$l l^-1^ and A~max~ with [CO~2~] of 1600 $\mu$l l^-1^ and PPFD of 1800 $\mu$mol photons m^-1^ s^-1^. This choice of light level to achieve light saturation is consistent with other studies on *Eucalyptus* species [@kallarackal1997ecophysiological;@pinkard1998photosynthetic;@crous2013photosynthesis;@drake2014capacity]. These measurements were conducted during midday (10:00-14:00 h) with leaf temperature maintained at 25 &deg;C. After CO~2~ and water vapor flux values stabilized in the leaf chamber, net CO~2~ assimilation rate and stomatal conductance (g~s~) were logged 5 times and averaged for both A~sat~ and A~max~. 

\
Photosynthetic CO~2~ response (AC~i~) curves were measured at 25 &deg;C on a random subset of each container size (n=3) after new leaves were first produced (March 13-14^th^, 2013) and prior to the final harvest (May 14-15~th~, 2013). Each AC~i~ curve was started at the reference [CO~2~] of 400 $\mu$l l^-1^ and then consisted of 12 additional steps from [CO~2~] of 50 to 1800 $\mu$l^-1^ at 25 &deg;C at saturating light (above). From these curves the photosynthetic parameters, J~max~ and Vc~max~, were quantified using the biochemical model of [@farquhar1980biochemical] and fit with the 'plantecophys' package [@duursma2015] in R [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2011].

\
Leaf dark respiration rates (R) was measured on each seedling during the same dates as AC~i~ curves. Freshly detached leaves were collected at least 1 hour after sundown and placed inside a conifer chamber attached to the Licor 6400. Measurements were taken at a reference [CO~2~] of 400 $\mu$l l^-1^ while leaf temperature was maintained at current ambient conditions. Reported values of R are standardized rates at 25 &deg;C using a Q~10~ value (1.86) developed for these seedlings in a separate experiment (Drake et al. unpublished). Leaf area and dry mass were recorded for each leaf during gas exchange campaigns.


## Leaf water potential
Predawn ($\Psi$~pd~) and midday ($\Psi$~l~) leaf water potentials were measured for each seedling using a PMS 1505D pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Albany, OR, USA) on fully expanded leaves during the same time period as AC~i~ and R. Leaves were detached and immediately stored inside foil covered bags before water potential measurements were performed. $\Psi$~pd~ was measured before sunrise and $\Psi$~l~ at midday 13:00-14:30 h. These measurements were used as a measure of static water stress on the seedlings [@sellin1999does] and to ensure that the bulk soil water availability was high enough for plants to avoid water stress as they became larger and roots filled the soil volume. 

## Leaf, root and soil chemistry
Leaves used in each gas exchange measurements and subsamples of harvested roots were dried to a constant mass and milled for analysis of N content, $\delta$^13^C, and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). Pre-planting soil samples (n=6) and subsamples of soil from each container following harvest were sieved to remove organic material, air dried and milled for analysis of N. Nitrogen concentrations of leaf and soil samples were determined using a Carlo Erba CE1110 elemental analyzer with thermal conductivity and mass spectromic detection (of N~2~ and CO~2~). The percentage of N in the sample was calculated by comparison with certified standards. Leaf $\delta$^13^C was analyzed  with an Delta V Advantage coupled to a Flash HT and Conflo IV isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Leaf samples were flash combusted at 1000&deg;C to convert to CO~2~, feed to the mass spectrometer and isotopic signatures are reported relative to the VPDP scale. 

\
Leaf total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration was analyzed on dried and milled leaf samples using a total starch assay kit (Megazyme International, Wicklow, Ireland) and includes the starch  and soluble sugar concentrations (mg g^-1^). Starch was quantified using a thermostable $\alpha$-amylase and amyloglucosidase assay [@McCleary_starch] and soluble sugars were determined following the anthrone method [@ebell1969variation]. Complete methods of the TNC assay are described in [@mitchell2013drought]. TNC-free specific leaf area (SLA~f~, m^2^ kg^-1^) for leaves sampled during gas exchange campaigns, were calculated by first subtracting the TNC content from individual dry leaf mass before dividing leaf area by leaf mass or the leaf N content. Similarly, TNC-free leaf N (N~f~, %) was calculated on all gas exchange leaves from leaf mass without TNC and leaf N content.

## Seedling growth model
We developed a simple seedling growth model that utilized leaf *A* rates to allocate daily C assimilate towards biomass production of stems, leaves, fine roots and coarse roots. The model begins with mean initial tissue component biomass (leaf~i~, stem~i~ and root~i~) and a starting leaf area (LA~i~) measured prior to planting. The initial biomass of roots was divided evenly between fine and coarse roots. The daily net biomass production of seedlings (P~i~) is then given by

\
(1)

where L is total plant leaf area (m^2^), C~day,i~ is the predicted daily carbon assimilation (g C g mass^-1^ d^-1^), $\sigma$~s~ is a self shading parameter (explained below), $\epsilon$~c~ is a biomass conversion efficiency parameter (g C g mass^-1^) and R is the mass based total respiration of all tissue components (g C d^-1^). Total respiration was calculated as 

\
(2)

where R~c~ is published or local tissue respiration rates of fine roots, coarse roots or stems (Table S1, g C g mass^-1^ d^-1^) and M~c~ is the standing biomass of each component (g). R~leaf~ is represented in the calculation of C~day~ (described below). The change in individual component biomass (M~c~), here solved on a daily time step, is given by

\
(3)

where A~c~ is the component specific biomass partitioning  to whole plant biomass (%) and $\Lambda$~c~ is component specific turnover rate (yr^-1^). Because we did not observe branch turnover, $\Lambda$~stem~ was assumed to equal 0.  Total seedling biomass, per time step, was then equal to the sum of all biomass components; leaves, stems, fine roots and coarse roots. 

\
C~day~ was predicted by using a coupled photosynthesis - stomatal conductance model [@farquhar1980biochemical;@medlyn2011reconciling] with the 'plantecophys' package in R with the mean photosynthetic parameters (J~max~, V~cmax~, R and g~1~) for each treatment and meteorological data from an onsite weather station. J~max~ and Vc~max~ were estimated from AC~i~ curves (explained above), R was empirically measured and the g~1~ parameter was generated by fitting the optimal stomatal conductance model from [@medlyn2011reconciling] with observed g~s~ values. Methods of the coupled leaf gas exchange model are described in Duursma et al [-@duursma2014peaked]. Combined with the meteorological parameters; PPFD, air temperature, and relative humidity, at 15 min intervals, leaf *A* rates ($\mu$mol CO~2~ m^-2^ s^-1^) were then predicted for each soil volume treatment. C~day~ was calculated by converting predicted rates to mass C gain over 15 min time steps (g m^-2^) and then summed for 24 h. This resulted in 120 unique values of C~day~ for each soil volume treatment, one value for each day of the experiment. Thus, each daily time step for model runs included a value of C~day~ that represented both treatment specific photosynthetic parameters and meteorological constraints across the duration of the experiment. 

\
It was further necessary to calculate a self-shading parameter ($\sigma$~s~) when scaling leaf *A* with total plant leaf area. This was accomplished by utilizing 61 previously digitized Eucalyptus seedlings, covering 5 total species which include *E. tereticornis*, from Duursma et al. [-@duursma2012light] to run in 'YplantQMC' package [@YplantQMC] in R to build a 3D plant structure based on digitized metrics of plant allometry and crown structure. Inputting the same treatment specific physiological parameters listed above, 'YplantQMC' outputs total *A*, using total leaf area, for seedlings assuming self-shading as well as for a full sun large horizontal leaf.  The ratio of total *A* with self-shading to horizontal leaf was then used to calculate $\sigma$~s~ for each of the 61 digitized seedlings, independently for each of the seven soil volume treatments. Next, the linear relationship between $\sigma$~s~ and total leaf area was for determined across digitized seedlings, within each treatment. For the growth model, $\sigma$~s~ was then predicted for each daily time step using the previous days cumulative leaf area and this value  was then applied to C~day,i~. All default parameters used in model simulations are reported in Table S1.

\
We then utilized this model to test the hypothesis that the effects of belowground sink limitation on rates of leaf *A* where sufficient to accurately predict overall seedling biomass production after 120 days. Each model run utilized changes in *A* and leaf mass fraction (LMF), with values of stem and root respiration rates, to generate total seedling mass and leaf area after 120 days.  Cumulative net leaf C gain for each treatment was equal to the sum of each value of C~day,i~ over 120 days and final seedling C was assumed to equal half of the final mass for both modeled and observed seedlings. 

\
First, a default model was fitted with mean photosynthetic parameters from the free seedlings and then optimized to produce a LMF which correctly predicted both the leaf mass and total biomass of the harvested free seedling (M~free~). This optimized LMF was then used to constrain model runs with soil volume treatment specific C~day~, while keeping tissue respiration and turnover parameters constant, to determine if changes in leaf A alone could predict biomass of seedlings in containers (M~pots~). Next, model sensitivity to different C allocation scenarios, including observed treatment specific LMF and up regulation of non-leaf tissue respiration by 50 % of default values (M~S1~ and M~S2~, respectively), was used to improve model biomass predictions compared to measured harvest biomass. For all cases, seedling biomass production was compared between model output and harvested seedlings with treatment specific mean C~day~ by first scaling values to the free seedling control.

##Data analysis
Differences in experimental parameters with soil volume were analysed by mixed-effects models in R with individual containers and experimental blocks as random effects and soil volume treatment as a categorical fixed effect with seven levels. Tukey's post-hoc tests were performed in conjunction with ANOVA to determine which specific paired comparisons among soil volume treatments were different. A linear mixed effect model of A~max~ and leaf chemistry was performed using the 'nlme' package [@Pinheiro2015] in R. Explained variance (R^2^) of mixed models were computed as in  [@nakagawa2013general]. Tests of allometric relationships between log-transformed biomass components were implemented using standardized major axis regression in the 'smatr' package in R [@warton2012smatr]. All tests of statistical significance were conducted at an alpha level of 0.05.

# Results

## Growth and morphology
Plant height, diameter and leaf area diverged between container volumes soon after start of the experiment (Figure `r allomfig`). First, seedling leaf area significantly diverged between soil volumes (P < 0.029) during the 5^th^ week of the experiment. Following this period both height (8^th^) week) and then diameter (9^th^ week) significantly deviated across soil volumes (P < 0.045 & 0.035, respectively). The large reductions in height gain and total leaf area in smaller compared to larger containers continued throughout the experiment. In this field study, colder temperatures and reductions in total PPFD per day (Figure `r airvarsfig`) likely slowed the growth of seedlings in the final weeks of the experiment (Figure `r allomfig`). Seedlings maintained diameter growth throughout the experiment, although marginal with smaller soil volumes in the final month. Final seedling height significantly increased with increasing soil volume (P < 0.001). Increases in both final stem diameter (P < 0.001) and cumulative leaf area (both P < 0.001) were found with increasing soil volume and these differences were driven mainly by the largest container and the free seedling treatments.

\
Total seedling biomass at harvest was significantly different across container volumes (P < 0.001) and between container treatments and free seedlings (P < 0.001, Table 1). On average, harvested biomass of free seedlings was 84% higher than seedlings in containers. Plant biomass was positively correlated with total leaf area across all treatments (R^2^ = 0.97, P < 0.001). Differences in biomass partitioning to leaves, stems and roots were not different across soil volumes after variation in seedling biomass across treatments was factored in the analysis (Figure `r allocfig`a,b). Across all treatments, the final harvest root:shoot biomass ratio was conserved in these seedlings which exhibited a slightly higher shoot than root mass ($\overline{x}$ = 0.904, 95% CI = [0.846,1.119]) and a near identical ratio of leaf to fine root mass (Figure `r allocfig`c).

\
Overall, SRL was higher in seedlings in containers compared to free seedlings but only in some of the container size treatments (Table 2, P = 0.009). Fine root length density was significantly higher in the two smallest container sizes and was the lowest in the largest container size (Table 2, P < 0.001). Over the duration of the experiment SLA~f~ was higher in free seedlings, but was not different across containers sizes (Table 1, P < 0.001) and this pattern was evident beginning in the first gas exchange measurement campaign (P < 0.001).

## Leaf and root chemistry
Leaf N~f~ was significantly higher in free seedlings and the largest container volume compared to the smaller container volumes at the onset of gas exchange measurements (6th week, P < 0.001). Throughout the remainder of the experiment the smallest container volume had a significant reduction in leaf N~f~ compared to other soil volumes, while free seedlings maintained the highest leaf N~f~ (Table 1, P < 0.001). Leaf starch content in the smallest container was ca. double  that of free seedlings (P = 0.039), while leaf soluble sugars did not differ across treatments throughout the experiment (Table 1). Differences in leaf starch between the free seedling and the smallest container were evident during the first gas exchange campaign (P = 0.001). Root N was higher in free seedlings compared to seedlings in containers but only for some of the container size treatments (Table 2).

## Gas exchange and photosynthetic parameters
At the first measurement campaign, both A~sat~ and A~max~ were significantly higher in the free seedling treatment compared to seedlings in containers (both P < 0.001). Across all measurement campaigns mean A~sat~ (Figure `r asatfig`) and A~max~ (Table 3) were consistently higher in free seedlings than in containers (26 % and 29 %, respectively). The relationships between photosynthetic capacity, leaf starch and leaf N on a mass basis was marginally significant (P = 0.058) but A~max~ on a mass basis was highly correlated to both leaf N content and leaf starch (both P < 0.001). We used predictions from the linear mixed effect model equation to visualize these relationship of A~max~ to either leaf N content or leaf starch at multiple bin levels (n=5) of the co-variate parameter (Figure `r achemfig`). Across all measurement campaigns and treatments A~max~ was higher when leaf N was also higher, usually associated with low levels of leaf starch (Figure `r achemfig`a). A~max~  was also lower when leaf starch was high as higher leaf N often did not coincide with high leaf starch (Figure `r achemfig`b). Overall, A~max~ was positively correlated with final harvest biomass across all seedlings (P < 0.001).

\
Both J~max~ and Vc~max~ were significantly higher in free seedlings (30 % and 26 %, respectively) than container-grown seedlings with little variation between container volume treatments (Table 3). Leaf dark respiration rates were not significantly different across soil volumes (Table 3). The g~1~ parameter, generated for each seedling from the Medlyn et al [-@medlyn2011reconciling] optimal stomatal conductance model, was lowest in the free seedling treatment and was marginally different across soil volume treatments (Table 3).

\
Neither $\Psi$~pd~ nor $\Psi$~l~ were different across treatments, with mean values of -0.27 and -1.2 MPa across all seedlings, respectively. Although g~s~ in free seedlings was generally higher than those in containers (Table 3. P < 0.001), the mean rates for all seedlings were high at 0.37 mol m^-2^ s^-1^ and did not change throughout the course of the experiment. Additionally, leaf $\delta$^13^C at final harvest was not different across treatments (Table 1). Combined these indices provide strong evidence that water stress was not apparent on these seedlings throughout the experiment. Soil N at harvest was not different across soil volumes ($\bar{x}$ = 4.5 %), with minimal decreases from pre-planting value ($\bar{x}$ = 4.9 %). This indicates that nutrient leaching from free seedlings or from draining of containers following natural rainfall events did not differ between treatments. 

## Modelling seedling biomass
The default model M~free~, successfully optimized a LMF (21.6 %) which then allowed the model to predict mean harvest total biomass of free seedlings within 1.2 %. Using this optimized LMF, the total biomass of modeled seedlings for each soil volume treatment (M~pots~) were on average 23&pm;2.4 g C more than measured seedling biomass when compared against predicted total net leaf C gain (Figure `r massmodelfig`a). Thus, seedling C mass was overestimated by an average of 50&pm;8.7 % in modeled seedlings across the soil volume treatments (Figure `r massmodelfig`b). As a result, the observed reductions in leaf *A* with decreasing soil volume when integrated across the 120 day experiment were not large enough to explain the reduction in observed seedling biomass across the  container size treatments.  

\
Next, we performed a series of model simulations to test possible C allocation scenarios to account for the over predictions of seedling C mass. Testing the sensitivity of the model to observed treatment-specific LMF from the final harvest (M~S1~), which were each lower than the optimized LMF value (see Figure `r allocfig`a), improved model predictions of seedling C mass but still overestimated seedling total C by 32&pm;11.1 % (Figure `r massmodelfig2`a). Using harvest values of LMF, however, does not capture the observed increase in leaf turnover of seedlings in small containers (Figure `r allomfig`c). Thus, the use of harvest LMF values for seedlings in containers in M~S1~ likely underestimates daily C allocation to leaves over the final months of the experiment. Increases of 50 % in non-leaf tissue respiration (M~S2~) improved biomass estimates slightly but overestimated mass C by an average of 46&pm;9.3 % in seedlings with soil volume restriction (Figure `r massmodelfig2`b). With M~S2~, non-tissue respiration rates would need to be increased by ca. 250% in order for mass balance to be achieved.

# Discussion
This study utilized a simple but novel field design to manipulate belowground sink limitation and physically restrict *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedling biomass production. We addressed questions regarding the coordination of *A~n~* and growth by complementing empirical results with a C mass balance model. We found that reductions in leaf *A~n~* across container sizes, when integrated across the 120 day experiment, were alone insufficient to account for observed reductions in total plant biomass production. 

## Reductions in growth and physiology under sink limitation
Soon after seedlings became established both height and diameter growth were negatively affected by decreasing soil volume. This led to the large reductions in biomass in small containers, compared to freely rooted seedlings. We analyzed the relationship between biomass growth and soil volume and found an increase of 34 % with a doubling of container volume, consistent with the meta-analysis of Poorter et al. [-@poorter2012pot]. These growth reductions were expected, as the impedance of root growth can cause reductions in overall plant growth and activity [@mcconnaughay1991physical; @young1997mechanical]. It has been shown that roots subjected to environmental stress may send inhibitory signals to the shoots that affect g~s~, cell expansion, cell division and the rate of leaf appearance [@passioura2002soil]. Here, this was evident in a large divergence in leaf area between seedlings in containers and free seedlings through time, with the eventual cessation of new leaf growth in seedlings in small containers.

\
Decreases in A~sat~ occurred at the same time as reductions in height and diameter of seedlings in containers. This initially suggests a strong link between growth and an apparent down regulation of *A~n~*. However, there are several possible mechanisms that can explain reduced *A~n~* in small containers including nutrient content, water or reduced sink strength [@poorter2012pot]. It was therefore necessary to examine each of these factors to determine if the induced belowground sink limitation actually triggered photosynthetic down regulation.

\
With high rates of g~s~, non-limiting leaf water potential and consistent leaf $\delta$^13^C across soil volume treatments there was little evidence that water stress caused the reduction in *A~n~*. This finding is consistent with other container size studies without drought treatments.  For example, reduced A~max~ in cotton seedlings grown at elevated CO~2~ was attributed to sink-limited feedback inhibition from inadequate rooting volume, not decreased g~s~ [@thomas1991root]. Additionally, severe reductions in *A~n~* in coffee plants were not attributed to impacts of container size on leaf water potentials or g~s~ [@ronchi2006growth]. It is likely that reductions in *A~n~* of well-watered seedlings observed in our study of *E.tereticornis* seedlings was instead the result of limiting soil nutrients or space restriction on belowground sink strength.

\
Here, reductions in *A~n~* were positively correlated with decreases in leaf N and leaf N was considerably reduced for seedlings in containers. As leaf N reductions were detected with TNC-free leaf mass, this suggests that physical root restriction or decreased supply likely affected seedling N uptake instead of TNC dilution in leaves in the smallest containers. Root N at the end of the experiment was on average higher in free seedlings but not consistently higher than every container volume treatment. Unrestricted mycorrhizal recruitment could have instead facilitated the increases in leaf N in free seedlings, but this effect is unknown. Combined with the fact that soil N declined evenly across all treatments, there was no clear mechanism present to identify changes in root N uptake between free seedlings and seedlings in containers. In these already low quality soils, it is possible that seedlings in containers simply grew into increasing N limitation which negatively affected belowground sink strength. Although no clear feedback could be determined between the available soil N pool and decreases in leaf N, the affects of belowground sink limitation on *A~n~* of seedlings in containers was evident throughout the experiment.

\
As both rooting space and resources were finite in containers, the inability of seedlings to maintain the capacity of the belowground C sink resulted in the buildup of C assimilate in leaves. The feedback inhibition of *A~n~* from starch accumulation has been proposed, yet it is still not known whether there is a starch threshold that triggers the down-regulation process (Nebauer et al. 2011).  Here, declines in A~max~ were correlated with higher starch content throughout the experiment. This agrees with a study on a deciduous conifer by Equiza et al. [-@equiza2006photosynthetic] where photosynthetic downregulation from reduced sink strength was correlated with starch content. As starch content in leaves of plants grown in the smallest containers was nearly double that of free seedlings in our study, this suggests the response of *A~n~* to sink inhibition was regulated by this accumulation, as hypothesized.

## Biomass partitioning under sink limitation
As biomass partitioning is likely controlled by the source and sink strength of all organs [@poorter2012biomass], it was important to determine which tissue components were most affected by the container size treatments. It was necessary to distinguish if growth was affected beyond ontogenetic constraints, by correcting for size, as biomass distribution is strongly size-dependent [@gould1966allometry; @lleonart2000removing]. In this study, there was no significant difference in root, leaf, or stem biomass partitioning with reduced soil volume compared to free seedlings, outside of ontogenetic drift (Figure `r allocfig`a,b). This is a surprising result as shifts in allocation have been noted specifically for nutrient limitation [@mcconnaughay1999biomass, and references therein]. Surprisingly, a constant ratio of fine root mass to leaf mass was observed across all treatments suggesting a functional partitioning response to optimize resource gain did not occur.

\
As partitioning to fine roots did not change this provides evidence against an optimal foraging strategy for seedlings in containers. This could be because lateral root development is affected by inanimate obstacles and avoiding growth towards container walls could improve the efficiency of resource allocation [@falik2005root]. The sensitivity of roots to their own exudates near obstructions may prevent further growth [@semchenko2008foraging]. Here, we show that FRLD was highest in smallest containers suggesting that root restriction likely occurred as simple function of available rooting space. Alternatively, physical restriction of root proliferation could also have impacted root development and morphology prior to shifts in mass partitioning. Here, increases in SRL where detected in several of the soil volume treatments. This is not surprising as plants in containers have been shown to have different root morphology to field grown plants [@nesmith1998effect]. The poor soil quality used in our experiment and root restriction, however, likely decreased the capacity of this morphological response to increase N uptake. 

## Do reductions in photosynthesis explain reductions in seedling growth?
Our model used a simple approach to drive seedling growth with measured reductions in leaf *A~n~* , via soil volume effects, while treating C use efficiency, respiration and C allocation as fixed processes. Contrary to expectation, the model consistently overestimated seedling growth in containers when parameterized with an optimized LMF for free seedlings. Although reductions in A~max~ and biomass were strongly correlated among treatments, as hypothesized by Poorter et al. [-@poorter2012pot], we provide evidence that the negative effects of sink limitation on *A~n~* can not fully explain explain reduced seedling growth. These findings are important as this model reflects classical approaches in tree growth and production modelling that are driven by inputs of C assimilation and processes such as respiration are considered proportional to biomass [@le2001carbon] or growth rate [@tjoelker1999acclimation]. It is possible that the overestimation of growth was due to an initial overestimation of *A~n~*, however, the robust empirical based methods used to generate photosynthetic parameters (J~max~, V~cmax~, R and g~1~) make this unlikely. 
Instead, our results indicate a need to evaluate how oversimplified representations of processes other than *A~n~* affect models which distinguish the fate of assimilate C within a plant. Doing so will provide valuable input to future models as assimilate allocation is a key component in carbon-balance driven  plant growth models, yet C partitioning remains a key weakness  [@lacointe2000carbon]. To address this issue, we utilized the flexibility of this model to test plausible fates of the pool of simulated non-biomass C unaccounted for with observed mass balance. Similar to Lohier et al. [-@lohier2014explaining] we manipulated processes contributing to modeled seedling C mass balance, including changes to leaf C allocation or non-leaf tissue respiration, to quantitatively test their respective influences on model predictions. 

\
Using measured LMF from the harvest, instead of the optimized seedling control (M~S1~), improved biomass predictions and provided insight into how sink limitation can impact leaf C allocation beyond *A~n~*. The sensitivity of the model to shifts in LMF could represent leaf loss throughout the experiment that could not be explicitly quantified in this field study. As TNC accumulation can lead to accelerated leaf senescence [@paul2001sink], this could explain the observed decline in total leaf area of seedlings in small containers. Future empirical and modelling studies should focus on how feedbacks from sink activity affect both rates of *A~n~* and the fate of C allocated to growth, respiration and C storage in leaves. It will be the interactions between these two components that will determine the total C gain available for plant growth.

\
Increasing rates of non-leaf respiration (M~S2~) improved biomass predictions but to a far lesser extent than changes to leaf C allocation. We also show that very large increases in non-leaf respiration rates would have been required to accurately predict observed seedling biomass. Although the fraction of photosynthate used in respiration is known to vary among species and is sensitive to changes in growth rates [@Lambers2008], results from M~S2~ highlight a lack of knowledge regarding how respiration rates of individual tissues, within a single plant, maybe be differentially affected by environmental change. This is noteworthy, as C balance is a delicate equilibrium between fluxes of *A~n~* and respiration, partial accounting of C dynamics can easily lead to erroneous conclusions [@valentini2000respiration]. These results infer that using fixed rates of respiration in models likely underestimates plant responses to sink limitation. Thus, we agree with Delucia et al. [-@delucia2007forest] that it is likely inappropriate to assume that respiration is a constant fraction of gross primary production in models. Our findings reveal that a combination of different mechanisms, beyond *A~n~*, are likely at play in driving the observed seedling biomass response to sink manipulation. However, the degree to which these mechanisms will regulate growth will undoubtedly shift across different experimental manipulations and plant species.

## Conclusions
With a novel field-based design we detected a massive effect of container volume on seedling growth, not between containers but with naturally planted seedlings. This is important as manipulations of plants grown in containers are often used to draw conclusions about growth and physiological principles, but how these results actually reflect field-grown plants has seldom been studied. Although biomass partitioning was conserved, our empirical and model results suggest that the amount of photosynthate allocated to non-biomass pools such as TNC or respiration were likely altered by sink inhibition. The debate over how rates of photosynthesis affect plant growth or to what degree these rates are instead controlled by growth has existed for decades [@sweet1966role]. Our combined empirical and modeling approach shows that when non-photosynthesis parameters were kept constant changes in *A~n~* were not able to fully to predict changes in growth, an important distinction often missed in studies that manipulate source/sink activity. 
K&#246;rner [-@korner2013growth] suggests that it is the norm for sink activity to feedback onto source activity, causing growth to control *A~n~* through the demand for C. Although this may be true, our results infer that quantifying the fate of assimilated C into known pools of growth, storage and C loss are needed prior to addressing this debate. Our modelling results agree with conclusions from Valentine and M&#228;kel&#228; [-@valentine2005bridging] where the problem with predicting tree growth is a problem in forecasting the assimilation and allocation of C and other constituents. The approach used here has the flexibility to account for multiple drivers of C allocation and provides an avenue to address future questions regarding the impact of environmental change on plant growth.

# Summary
* Light gradients within tree canopies play a major role in the distribution of plant resources that define photosynthetic capacity of individual leaves. A lack of empirical data relating photosynthesis to leaf physiological behavior within tree canopies, however, impedes our ability to assess the contribution of shade leaves to canopy carbon gain.
* To investigate the CO~2~ diffusion pathway of sun and shade leaves, leaf gas exchange was coupled with online carbon isotope discrimination to measure net leaf photosynthesis (*A~n~*), stomatal conductance (g~s~) and mesophyll conductance (g~m~) in *Eucalyptus tereticornis* trees grown in climate controlled whole tree chambers.
* Compared to sun leaves, shade leaves had lower A, g~m~, Vc~max~, J~max~ and leaf nitrogen but maintained similar rates of g~s~. When light intensity was increased from low light to high light for shade leaves both g~s~ and g~m~ increased rapidly, leading to increases in A greater than sun leaves at the same PPFD. 
* Here we show that dynamic physiological responses of shade leaves to altered light environments has important implications for upscaling leaf level measurements and predicting whole canopy carbon gain. We argue that the rapid response of g~m~ with light enables shade leaves to respond quickly to sunflecks. Evidence that g~m~ not only varies within a canopy but can be up-regulated over short time intervals possibly represents a new mechanism underpinning leaf gas exchange responses to light.

# Introduction
Light availability is one of the most important environmental drivers of leaf carbon (C) uptake in trees. Predicting C uptake if forests usually involves upscaling leaf level measurements to assess whole canopy function. Due to the costs and limitations of efficient light harvesting, plants cannot expose all leaves to full sun [@niinemets2010review], making simple upscaling based on solar irradiance problematic. Incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) declines exponentially with cumulative leaf area index, creating a steep light gradient from the canopy top to bottom [@monsi2005factor]. Consequently, structural and functional properties of leaves are modified to efficiently use light [@vogelman1996leaves; @valladares2004photosynthetic], as changing irradiance strongly affects rates of leaf photosynthesis (*A~n~*) [@evans1995carbon]. To estimate whole canopy C gain it is thus necessary to account for the non-linear response of A to light by distinguishing between shaded and sunlit leaves [@de1997simple; @linderson2012up].

\
The distribution of resources required for *A~n~*, including leaf nitrogen (N) and supply of water, are also partially defined by canopy light gradients. As *A~n~* has a saturating response with light and maximum rates depend in part on N-rich photosynthetic machinery, it has been argued that leaf N should be proportional to PPFD along the canopy light gradient to maximize canopy C gain at a given total canopy N [@field1983allocating; @field1986photosynthesis; @peltoniemi2012co]. Changes in chlorophyll per unit N, chlorophyll a:b ratios, electron transport capacity per unit chlorophyll, and ratios of electron transport capacity to Rubisco activity can also occur in response to changes in irradiance [@evans2001photosynthetic]. Sun leaves frequently experience greater water limitations in the upper canopy, despite effective vascular systems developed for high radiation loads and transpiration [@sellin2008effects; @niinemets2012optimization]. Higher rates of *A~n~* and stomatal conductance (g~s~) can only be sustained if the leaf specific hydraulic conductance (K~l~) is also large enough to avoid low leaf water potentials [@hubbard2001stomatal]. Optimal photosynthetic N investment in the upper canopy will be ineffective in enhancing *A~n~* if water supply is insufficient [@niinemets2012optimization; @peltoniemi2012co], thus K~l~ should also be higher in the upper canopy to supply sunlit leaves with sufficient water [@burgess2006hydraulic;@sellin2007effects ;@sellin2008effects].

\
Rates of photosynthesis in C~3~ plants are limited by the [CO~2~] available for fixation by Rubisco within the chloroplast and this [CO~2~] is a function of the drawdown of CO~2~ from the atmosphere to the site of carboxylation [@warren2008stand]. This drawdown consists of multiple resistance pathways to CO~2~ diffusion which include CO~2~ diffusion from the atmosphere through stomata (stomatal conductance, g~s~) and then from these intercellular air spaces into the chloroplast (mesophyll conductance, g~m~). Based on optimal theory, regulation of g~s~ within a tree canopy should act to efficiently utilize available supplies of light, N and water to maximize *A~n~* [@peltoniemi2012co]. This is because stomata are hypothesized to exhibit an optimal behaviour to maximize C gain while simultaneously minimizing water loss through transpiration [@cowan1977stomatal]. Mesophyll conductance can also impose limitations on *A~n~* as large g~s~ [@warren2008stand; @ubierna2011estimation], reducing the efficiency of leaf N use in *A~n~* [@niinemets2007photosynthesis] if g~m~ constrains CO~2~ supply to the chloroplast. Part of the variation in photosynthetic capacity between sun and shade leaves has been proposed to be due to differences in g~m~ [@piel2002effect; @warren2007internal], yet the trade-offs that constrain this diffusion pathway are yet to be explicitly quantified. Stomatal and mesophyll conductance should not be considered independent of each other [@griffiths2013mesophyll], but a lack empirical data currently hinders are ability to interpreting their coupled responses to *A~n~* across sun and shade leaves. 

\
Additionally, assessing shade leaf behaviour is made difficult with accounting of short term light fluctuations within a canopy, via sunflecks. How shade leaves utilize sunflecks for short term C gain depends on the combined response time of g~s~ and g~m~ and the underlying photosynthetic biochemistry acclimated to a low light environment [@pearcy1990sunflecks;@tausz2005dynamic]. The utilization of sunflecks is first limited by delayed responses of stomata opening, which may take minutes, effectively limiting the maximum assimilation rate that can be achieved [@pearcy1990sunflecks; @vicomanz2011; @way2012sunflecks]. Mesophyll conductance has been shown to respond to environmental factors (e.g. CO~2~, temperature or vapor pressure deficit) at timescales of minutes, possibly faster than g~s~ [@flexas2008mesophyll and references therein], yet short term response to light availability are unclear. For example, g~m~ was found to be independent of light intensity in wheat leaves [@tazoe2009light] but was responsive to light in tobacco [@flexas2007rapid]. Anatomical parameters which regulate g~m~ with changing irradiance such as chloroplast surface area [@terashima2006irradiance] and mesophyll thickness [@boardman1977comparative] are also unlikely to adjust during short light fluctuations. The physiological behaviour of shade leaves to maximize C gain must be assessed as both a degree of acclimation to local irradiance and as a potential response to transitory light availability.

\
Climate warming may also affect the physiological behaviour of leaves within a canopy. This is because leaves can be exposed to different heat, water and high light stresses as temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) vary with canopy light availability [@baldocchi2002environment; @valladares2004photosynthetic; @niinemets2007photosynthesis]. How these stresses affect the diffusion of CO~2~, through either g~s~ or g~m~, will have implications for upscaling *A~n~* for sun and shade leaves. Additionally, light saturated rates of A are limited by the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vc~max~) or the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J~max~) across a range of temperatures, yet their temperature dependencies are not the same [@farquhar1980biochemical; @medlyn2002temperature]. How these parameters are differentially affected by warming may impact constraints of N distribution and leaf photosynthetic capacity across light gradients. The impacts of warming on plant physiological processes are obviously vast, yet differentiating their impacts on leaf physiology within a canopy will be essential to evaluate whole tree responses to a changing climate.

\
In this study we use *Eucalyptus tereticornis* Sm. trees, planted in climate controlled whole tree chambers with ambient and elevated temperature (ambient +3&deg;C) treatments, to empirically evaluate the distribution of nitrogen and water supply and leaf physiological behaviour of sun and shade leaves. Our hypotheses are as follows:

\
1.	If whole tree canopies are optimized for C gain, then leaf N, hydraulic conductance and biochemical photosynthetic capacity are predicted to be higher in sun leaves compared to shade leaves.

\
2.	Stomatal conductance is proportional to *A~n~* across sun and shade leaves under similar leaf VPD and g~m~ scales positively with photosynthetic capacity.

\
3. As shade leaves were expected to develop lower biochemical photosynthetic capacity and leaf physiological responses to light are typically slow (minutes), increases in *A~n~* following sunfleck simulations were not expected to reach rates of full sun leaves.

\
4.	The effects of climate warming were predicted to be greater in sun than shade leaves, seen as a decrease in g~s~ and leaf C gain during summer months, as increased evaporation demand from higher temperatures will lead to stomatal closure.

# Materials and Methods

## Whole tree chamber experimental design
Twelve *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings, chosen from a single local Cumberland plain cohort, were planted in March 2013 into 12 whole-tree chambers (WTC) at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment site near Richmond, NSW, Australia. Each chamber has a height of 9 m and seedlings were grown for 15 months. A detailed description of the WTC operation and design is available in [@barton2010whole]. Six chambers were set to match outside ambient air temperatures (AT) while the remaining 6 experienced an elevated air temperature treatment of +3&deg;C (ET, Figure `r airvarfig`). Trees grew quickly and developed large canopies, with height growth reaching the top of the WTCs over the experiment duration. Trees were watered weekly with 70 L from March 2013 to November 2013. From October 2013 to the end of the experiment trees were watered every 15 days with the mean monthly rainfall amount for Richmond, NSW. In February 2013 half of the chambers (3 each of AT and ET) were subjected to a drought treatment by withholding watering. Due to a limited range of data for the drought treatment only well-watered trees are reported, which reduces the sample size of WTC (n=6 to n=3) for the final 3 months of the experiment.

\
Before seedlings were planted into each chamber they were maintained under well-watered conditions in 25 L pots and kept inside each chamber. This allowed for seedlings to gain sufficient size before planting while also allowing them to acclimate to chamber temperature treatments. Seedlings were planted into each chamber after mean seedling height reached 100 cm. The top soils at this site, used in both pots and chambers, are an alluvial formation of low-fertility sandy loam soils (380 and 108 mg kg-1 total N and phosphorus respectively) with low organic matter (0.7 %) and low water holding capacity. A root exclusion barrier extended from chamber walls to the hard layer (ca. 1 m) and roots were allowed to grow freely below the barrier. Leaf gas exchange measurements were initiated in October 2013 when trees had both ample height growth and canopy development for realistic canopy light gradients to be measured. At this point, trees under AT treatment had a mean diameter of 28.2&pm;1.1 mm, height of 348&pm;15.1 cm and an leaf area of 3.9&pm;0.1 m^2^. For ET treatments, trees had a mean diameter of 34.1&pm;2.1 mm, height of 418.3&pm;23.1 cm and an leaf area of 6.2&pm;0.2 m^2^. Leaf area was calculated based on leaf counts and mean leaf size.

##Leaf gas exchange, online carbon isotope discrimination and mesophyll conductance
Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed six times, beginning in October 2013 and monthly from December 2013 to April 2014. Measurements were taken on a representative sun and shade leaf for each tree during each measurement campaign. The newest fully expanded leaf from the branch apex was chosen for gas exchange measurements and sun leaves were measured in the upper third of the canopy. Here, shade leaves are defined as inner-canopy leaves developing on secondary branches in a low light environment. Shade leaves were always measured in the lower canopy, but leaves were sampled on subsequent higher branches across measurement campaigns to minimize confounding effects of leaf age. As shade leaves most likely developed slower this assured that older leaves in the bottom canopy were avoided.

\
Prior to gas exchange measurements photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was recorded as a point measurement at the individual leaf level and a spatially averaged measurement at the canopy position for each selected leaf.  A hand-held quantum sensor (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to record leaf level PPFD to ensure that chosen leaves were positioned in the desired light environment, either full sun or full shade. A ceptometer (AccuPAR LP-80, Decagon Devices, Pullman, USA) was then used to measure a spatially averaged PPFD at the canopy height of each chosen leaf type. Each ceptometer reading integrated an array of 80 sensors over a total length of 84 cm. Five ceptometer readings were recorded at different locations within the canopy, but at the same height and close to each selected leaf. The mean of these readings was assumed to represent the local light environment of sun and shade leaves for each tree. All measurements of PPFD and gas exchange were performed on sunny days between 10:00-14:30 h.

\
Leaf level gas exchange was measured with a standard (2 x 3 cm) leaf cuvette using a portable gas exchange system (LI-6400XT, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).  This system was coupled with a tunable diode laser (TDL; TGA100,Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) for concurrent measurements of online C isotope discrimination. The CO~2~ in the leaf cuvette was set at ambient atmospheric [CO~2~] (400 ppm) with a flow rate of 200 $\mu$mol s^-1^. Two identical gas exchanges systems were run simultaneously, one in each of a randomly chosen WTC for each temperature treatment. Leaf temperatures were controlled at the current AT or ET WTC air temperature. PPFD in the cuvette was set to match the individual light environment of each leaf type (explained above). Periods of high irradiance were simulated for shade leaves by increasing the leaf cuvette PPFD (LI-COR red/blue light source) to match the light environment of the full sun leaf in the same tree. The maximum sunfleck response of shade leaves was then recorded once CO~2~ and water vapor fluxes re-stabilized in the leaf cuvette (ca. 25 min). 

\
Once CO~2~ and water vapor flux values were stable for each leaf measurement, the sample and reference gas lines were diverted to the TDL via T-junctions inserted into the reference gas tube and match valve outlet of the LI-6400. The gas streams were dried by passing through napion gas dryers in the respective gas lines, and then ^12^CO~2~ and ^13^CO~2~ concentrations were measured for each gas stream by the TDL. Reference, sample and two calibration gases were run on alternating 80 s loops (20 s each), one for each AT and ET leaf at a matched canopy position, for a total of 12 min. This allowed for 4-5 measurements per leaf and data were averaged over the last 10 s of reference line and samples line gas streams for calculations. The two calibration gases were drawn from compressed air tanks (330 and 740 ppm CO~2~) in order to correct for gain drift of the TDL on each measurement cycle. Photosynthesis, g~s~, transpiration, VPD and intercellular [CO~2~] (C~i~) were auto-logged every 15 s for each gas exchange system over the same 12 min interval.

\
Using online C isotope discrimination measurements, the difference  between the observed discrimination and what is predicted for light saturated gas exchange is proportional to g~m~ [@griffiths2013mesophyll]. First, leaf C isotope discrimination was calculated by comparing the isotopic composition of the reference gas entering the leaf cuvette ($\delta$^13^C~e~) with the sample gas ($\delta$^13^C~o~) such that:

\
(1)

where R~s~ is the isotopic ratio of the sample and R~stnd~ is the isotopic ratio of the standard Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDP). Next, the observed discrimination ($\Delta$~obs~) is calculated from Evans et al. [-@evans1986carbon]:

\
(2)

where:

\
(3)

and $\xi$ is the ratio of the CO~2~ entering the well mixed leaf cuvette to the CO~2~ draw down in the gas stream by the leaf.

\
Second, C isotope discrimination during C~3~ photosynthesis ($\Delta$) is the resultant discrimination from CO~2~ diffusion from the atmosphere to the site of carboxylation, consisting of a series of fractionation steps described in Evans et al. [-@evans1986carbon]. In this experiment, a modified form of this equation presented in Evans & Von Caemmerer [-@evans2013temperature] with ternary effect corrections by Farquhar & Cernusak [-@farquhar2012ternary] was used such that:

\
(4)

where $\Delta$~o~ is the observed discrimination and  $\Delta$~i~, $\Delta$~gm~ , $\Delta$~e~ and $\Delta$~f~ are the contributions to fractionation if C~i~ = C~c~, g~m~, respiration and photorespiration, respectively. The equations for each are as follows:

\
(5)
\
(6)

\
(7)


\
(8)


where the different fractionation factors include; diffusion through water (a~i~, 1.8&permil;), Rubisco carboxylation (b, 29&permil;), the photorespiratory fractionation (f, 16.2&permil;) and the combined fractionation through the boundary layer and the stomata (a'). a' is defined by:

\
(9)


where C~s~ is the CO~2~ partial pressure at the leaf surface, a~b~ is the fractionation from boundary layer diffusion (2.9&permil;) and a is the fractionation due to diffusion in air (4.4&permil;) [@evans1986carbon]. C~a~ and C~i~ are the atmospheric and intercellular partial pressures and $\Gamma_{*}$ is the compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration in the light (R~d~). In this experiment both $\Gamma_{*}$ and R~d~ were derived using a standard Arrhenius function with parameters for *Eucalyptus globulus* from [@crous2012light]. The ternary effect corrections (t) are described by:

\
(10)


where E denotes the transpiration rate and $\text{g}^t_{ac}$ is the total conductance to CO~2~ diffusion to both the boundary layer and stomatal conductance.

\
The CO~2~ diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the chloroplast, g~m~, is given by its relationship to the leaf photosynthesis rate (*A~n~*) by:

\
(11)


where C~c~ is the chloroplast CO~2~ partial pressure. Once g~m~ was calculated C~c~ and the drawdown of CO~2~ from the intercellular air spaces to the site of carboxylation were then estimated using Equation 11. Examples of this approach to measure gas exchange and C isotope discrimination are presented in Evans and Von Caemmerer [-@evans2013temperature]. The variation in $\Delta$~o~ between sun and shade leaves and the simulated sunfleck where then compared as a function of C~i~:C~a~.  

##Biochemical parameters of photosynthesis
Photosynthetic CO~2~ response (AC~i~) curves were measured at 25 &deg;C for one sun and shade leaf for each WTC prior to the initiation of the drought treatment. Each AC~i~ curve began at the reference [CO~2~] of 400 $\mu$l l^-1^ and then consisted of 12 additional steps from [CO~2~] of 50 to 1800 $\mu$l l^-1^ at 25 &deg;C at saturating light (1800 $\mu$mols m^-1^ s^-1^). From these curves the photosynthetic parameters, J~max~ and Vc~max~, were quantified using the biochemical model of [@farquhar1980biochemical] and fit with the 'plantecophys' package [@duursma2015] in R [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2011].

##Leaf chemistry and hydraulic parameters
Following gas exchange measurements each leaf was collected, measured for leaf water potential (explained below), scanned for leaf area, dried and weighed. These leaves were then milled and analyzed for leaf N content and $\delta$^13^C. Leaf samples were analysed on a Delta V Advantage coupled to a Flash HT and Conflo IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) in dual-reactor setup. Samples were flash combusted at 1000&deg;C and converted to CO~2~ and N~2~ and then subjected to stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Leaf N is reported on an area basis (N~a~, g m^-2^) and isotopic signatures are reported relative to the VPDP scale.

\
Predawn ($\Psi_{pd}$) and midday ($\Psi_l$) leaf water potentials (MPa) were measured for sun and shade leaves during each gas exchange campaign using a PMS 1505D pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Albany, OR, USA). The leaf closest to the leaf used for gas exchange was sampled for measurement of $\Psi_{pd}$. Predawn leaf water potential was measured before sunrise on the same day as gas exchange measurements. Leaves used for gas exchange were immediately sampled for $\Psi_l$ once measurements were completed. All leaves were detached and immediately stored inside foil covered bags before water potential measurements were performed. Leaf water potential and transpiration (E, mmol^-2^ m^-2^ s^-1^) from gas exchange were then used to calculate leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (K~l~, mmol m^-2^ s^-1^ MPa) through the equation:

\
(12)


Leaf level instantaneous transpiration efficiency (ITE) was calculated as A divided by E. The g~1~ parameter was estimated from ITE to VPD response curves by fitting a rearranged optimal g~s~ model for ITE [@medlyn2011reconciling] using non-linear regression, where k=0.5 [see @duursma2013near]. Small values of g~1~ indicate that transpiration is costly in C terms and plants are then likely to exhibit conservative water use [@lin2015optimal].

##Data analysis
Differences in experimental parameters to either the warming treatment or leaf type were analysed by mixed-effects models in R [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2011] with WTC as a random effect. Explained variance (R^2^) of mixed models were computed as in  [@nakagawa2013general]. Confidence intervals (95 %) of mixed effect linear models were generated using bootstrapping methods with 999 simulations, using the bootMer function in the 'lme4' package [@bates2013lme4]. For non-linear relationships, confidence intervals were estimated by fitting a generalized additive model to the data with the 'mgcv' package, using WTC as a random effect. All tests of statistical significance were conducted at an alpha of 0.05.

# Results

## Leaf resource distribution
Across six measurement campaigns over the 7 month period PPFD was  reduced on average by >75% in the shade (Figure `r parfig`). Leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (K~l~) was similar across sun and shade leaves (Table 1). This was because $\Psi_{pd}$, $\Psi_l$ (Table 1) and E (Table 2) did not differ between leaf types. Leaf N~a~ was approximately 20% higher in sun leaves compared to shade leaves (Table1). Leaf mass per area was not different between leaf types. No effect of the warming treatment was detected with  PPFD, $\Psi_{pd}$, $\Psi_l$, K~l~, E, N~area~ or LMA either within or across leaf types.

## Photosynthetic capacity and leaf photosynthesis rates 
The photosynthetic parameters J~max~ and Vc~max~ were higher in sun compared to shade leaves (Table 1), as estimated from AC~i~ curves (Figure `r acifig`a). Within leaf types, no effect of the warming treatment was detected on either parameter. Among the sampled leaves, Vc~max~ was positively related to leaf N~a~ across leaf types and temperature treatments (P = 0.01, Figure `r acifig`b).

\
Mean *A~n~* was significantly higher in sun compared to shade leaves (+23%), when measured at their local light environment (Table 2). Additionally, leaf N~a~ was positively related to *A~n~* across gas exchange campaigns and leaf types measured under ambient light and temperature conditions (P < 0.001, Figure `r acifig`c). Following an increase in light intensity to match high-light conditions, A of shade leaves increased to values significantly greater than sun leaves at high light (P < 0.001, Table 2). No effect of the warming treatment was detected on *A~n~* of sun leaves measured at high light or shade leaves at either low or high light. Photosynthesis within leaf types and treatments was similar through time and across the range of leaf temperatures measured (Figure `r get1fig`a).

## Stomatal conductance and leaf water-use efficiency
On average, g~s~ was 18% higher in shade compared to sun leaves under their local light environment (Table 2). Photosynthesis was positively correlated with g~s~ in all leaves measured under high light conditions, however, g~s~ and *A~n~* were not correlated in shade leaves under low light (Figure `r agmgsfig`a). Following increased PPFD, g~s~ of shade leaves was significantly greater than both shade leaves at low light and sun leaves, pooled across all measurement dates (Figure `r gebarfig`a). No effect of the warming treatment was detected on g~s~ within or across leaf types. Stomatal conductance within leaf types and treatments was similar through time and across the range of leaf temperatures measured (Figure `r get2fig`b).

\
Measured under ambient light and temperature conditions leaf ITE was significantly greater in sun leaves than in shade leaves at low light (+21%, P = 0.001). Following an increase in  PPFD to high-light conditions, ITE of shade leaves did not differ from shade leaves at low light and was still significantly lower than sun leaves (P < 0.001). Instantaneous transpiration efficiency in sun leaves was reduced in the warming treatment, but no warming effect was detected in shade leaves measured at low or high light (Table 2). The mean estimated g~1~ for sun leaves was 1.51&pm;0.11 and for shade leaves with low and high light was 2.59&pm;0.12 and 2.74&pm;0.04. For all leaf types and light treatments there was a strong response of ITE to VPD and individual data points broadly corresponded to response curves from the optimal ITE model with a g~1~ value for each leaf type and treatment (Figure `r waterusefig`a).  Within leaf types and light treatments the response of VPD to leaf temperature was similar across all measurement campaigns (Figure `r get2fig`a).

\
Bulk-leaf $\delta$^13^C, as an index of integrated water-use efficiency [@marshall2007sources], was significantly lower in shade leaves compared to sun leaves by ca. 2&permil; (Table 1). No effects of the warming treatment on leaf $\delta$^13^C were detected. Leaf $\delta$^13^C and N~area~ were positively correlated for all leaves (P<0.001, Figure `r waterusefig`b), with less negative $\delta$^13^C (higher water-use efficiency) and higher N investment in sun leaves.

## Leaf carbon isotope discrimination and mesophyll conductance
The observed carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta_o$) measured during photosynthesis was positively correlated with C~i~:C~a~ for all leaf types (P < 0.001), with larger $\Delta$~o~ detected for sun leaves and shade leaves at high light than shade leaves at low light (Figure `r deltafig`). Carbon isotope discrimination associated with g~m~ accounted for the majority of $\Delta_o$ (69.7&pm;0.4%) and varied little across measurement temperatures, leaf types, or warming treatments. The remainder $\Delta_o$ consists of the contributions of g~s~, respiration and photorespiration to discrimination. 

\
Mean g~m~ was higher in sun compared to shade leaves (+27%) under their local light environment (P < 0.001). Following a short-term increase in PPFD from low to high light, g~m~ of shade leaves increased to values significantly greater than sun leaves (Table 2). Proportional increases in g~m~ were matched by proportional increases in *A~n~* from low to high light in shade leaves (Figure `r gebarfig`b,c). Photosynthesis scaled positively with increases in g~m~ for all leaves, with similar intercepts but different slopes between leaf type and light treatment (P = 0.0186). The large increases in g~m~ in shade leaves under high light resulted in the highest rates of *A~n~* (Figure `r agmgsfig`b). No differences in g~m~ were detected with the warming treatment within leaf types. Mesophyll conductance did not vary across measurements campaigns within leaf types and light treatments (Figure `r get1fig`b), but a weak negative relationship with increasing leaf temperature was detected with sun and shade leaves under their local light environment (P = 0.001 & 0.04, respectively). We also simulated AC~c~ curves to determine if treatment differences in J~max~ and Vc~max~ where instead the result of differences in g~m~. Comparison of A-Cc curves (Figure `r accfig`) and A-Ci curves revealed similar differences between sun and shade leaves.

## Variation in intercellular and chloroplastic CO~2~ concentrations
Higher rates of g~s~ in shade leaves under low and high light lead to significant increases in C~i~ compared to sun leaves (Figure `r ciccfig`a). The chloroplast CO~2~ partial pressure was comparable between shade leaves when measured at both low and high light conditions (Figure `r ciccfig`c). In sun leaves C~c~ was significantly lower than shade leaves as a likely consequence of a lower C~i~. The drawdown of CO~2~ from intercellular spaces to the chloroplast, C~i~-C~c~, measures the coordination between g~m~ and *A~n~* [@caemmerer2014temperature]. This drawdown was similar between sun and shade leaves measured at their local light environment and increased marginally in shade leaves at high light (Figure `r ciccfig`c). This was the result of the proportional relationship between g~m~ and *A~n~* across all leaves. The CO~2~ drawdown from C~a~ to C~i~ and C~i~ to C~c~ were both relatively stable across the range of temperatures measured and gas exchange campaigns (Figure `r get2fig`c and `r get1fig`c, respectively).

# Discussion
Here we show that *A~n~* in leaves within canopies of *Eucalyptus tereticornis* are limited by their local light environment, however, shade leaves increased rates of leaf C gain exceeding sun leaves when light availability increased. Although shade leaves in lower light environments exhibited relatively high g~s~ and c~i~, it was rapid increases in g~m~ under periods of high light availability that led to this up-regulation of *A~n~*. Although we know shade leaves experience transient periods of sun and shade [@pearcy1990sunflecks], a lack of empirical data within tree canopies currently impedes our ability to predict whole canopy C gain. These findings offer new insights into how aspects of leaf physiology may be optimized differently in sun and shade leaves and reveal how the total leaf CO~2~ conductance pathway should be accounted for when testing optimizations of canopy C uptake in future studies. Additionally, with measurements recorded across a large natural range of air temperatures only minimal effects a +3 &deg;C warming treatment were detected on leaf physiology.

## Resource distribution and photosynthetic capacity
The allocation of N~a~ constrains *A~n~* and is thus a key trait in determining the relative contribution of individual leaves to canopy C gain. Decreasing light availability should decrease the investment into photosynthetic enzyme within a canopy (Mooney and Gulmon 1979). As a result, acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to irradiance is typically reflected in the key photosynthetic biochemical parameters Vc~max~ and J~max~ [@farquhar1980biochemical]. Our data agree with these conventional conclusions as the distribution of N~a~, both measures of photosynthetic capacity and *A~n~* were all reduced in shade leaves. Leaf mass area, however, was not different between sun and shade leaves. This could be due to leaf formation under comparative light conditions or possible differences in total non-structural carbohydrates contents between leaf types.

\
Photosynthesis is also limited by the ability to supply water to the upper canopy. Ultimately, the ability of a trees hydraulic architecture to supply water to foliage across increasing pathlengths affects productivity and survival [@sellin2008effects]. Using a two-leaf model, Peltoniemi et al. [-@peltoniemi2012co] theorizes that optimal N distribution will be proportional to light distribution only if K~l~ is also optimally distributed. In this study, variation in leaf N distribution and *A~n~* rates were not associated with subsequent changes in K~l~ between sun and shade leaves. Thus, no direct relationship between water supply and N distribution or *A~n~* within the canopy were detected.

Unexpected higher rates of g~s~ in shade leaves compared to sun leaves led to decreased ITE throughout the experiment. Additionally, consistently higher leaf $\delta$^13^C in shade leaves suggests that this pattern was likely prevalent long term. From a canopy perspective this pattern in water-use efficiency initially appears to be detrimental to C gain as *A~n~* in sun leaves was characterized by low rates of g~s~ and low C~i~. Relative to the differences in *A~n~* between leaf types, higher rates of g~s~ in shade leaves appear to exhibit inefficient water use. As whole canopy C gain integrates the efficiency of all leaves, this begs the question of why shade leaves maintained a lower ITE compared to sun leaves.

## Physiological behaviour of sun and shade leaves
The pattern of inefficient water use in shade leaves is important as we hypothesized that g~s~ and *A~n~* would be proportional across sun and shade leaves. In sun leaves, *A~n~* and g~s~ were strongly correlated, exhibiting behaviour broadly consistent with optimal stomatal theory. However, lower rates of *A~n~* in shade leaves were not coupled with decreases in g~s~, explaining the observed decreases in ITE. This is significant as optimal stomatal regulation to balance C gain with water loss has been reported across a wide range of ecosystems and plant functional types; however, empirical data is often collected only on full sun leaves [see @prentice2014balancing; @lin2015optimal]. As a result, the often used economic framework of balancing costs of using water versus N allocation to predict *A~n~* [@wright2003least] may break down when considering all leaves within a tree canopy.

\
It is possible that reducing stomatal response time, by sustaining higher g~s~, is a strategy to take advantage of high light quickly in shade leaves [@tausz2005dynamic]. Evidence from this study supports this hypothesis, as shade leaves increased A equivalent or even outperforming sun leaves under identical light intensity. Transpiration-induced cooling in shade leaves, by keeping stomata open, has also been suggested as an effective strategy to reduce sunfleck induced thermal load [@schymanski2013stomatal]. This is because rapid increases in leaf temperature with sunflecks have been shown to inhibit C gain [@leakey2003high]. However, this response likely occurs at very high air temperatures and may not explain the observed g~s~ in shade leaves across the large natural range of temperatures included in this study. How prevalent each of these strategies are within tree canopies is still unknown, as empirical studies assessing photosynthetic responses to sunflecks generally focus on seedlings [@kuppers1993leaf;@pepin1997rates;@leakey2002relative] and understory plants, often in deep shade [@chazdon1991importance; @allen2000stomatal; @brantley2009contribution]. Thus, our findings highlight a critical need for empirical measurements of shade leaves under dynamic light environments in order to accurately scale C gain from leaf to canopy [see @de1997simple].

\
We found that *A~n~* and g~m~ scaled positively across leaf types and, surprisingly, increased rapidly (within minutes) and proportionately when light intensity was increased in shade leaves.  Research has suggested that aquaporins can facilitate increases in the CO~2~ permeability of the cell membranes resulting in rapid modulation of g~m~ [@hanba2004overexpression; @heinen2009role; @li2014plant]. This provides a potential explanation for the observed rapid increases in g~m~ but the impacts of aquaporins on g~m~ are untested in leaves of tree species. Our findings support a growing wealth of evidence that g~m~ is highly variable and can respond to environmental variables [@flexas2008mesophyll]. Here we provide empirical data showing g~m~ not only varies within a canopy but the up-regulation of g~m~ plays a critical role in the photosynthetic response of shade leaves to sunflecks. 

\
If shade leaves "lie in wait" for sunflecks then perhaps we should consider an alternate leaf economic strategy to maximize C gain, beyond conventional trade-offs associated with canopy resource distribution. This is because the role of g~s~ in regulating photosynthetic induction impacts the capacity of a leaf to utilize sunflecks [@way2012sunflecks]. If the valuation of sunflecks as a C resource is large enough then costs of sub-optimal stomatal behaviour could be offset over the leaf lifespan. For example, the potential C gain in leaves where sunflecks constitute a large proportion of total daily PFFD may be large enough to tolerate decreases in ITE However, accounting for the heterogeneous nature of light within a canopy remains a current challenge for empirical and modelling studies. Thus, models which predict leaf photosynthesis from N distribution within a canopy will be incomplete unless inclusion of canopy light extinction and the integration of sunflecks on shade leaves are included [@de1997simple].  

## Conclusions
Here we show that dynamic physiological responses of shade leaves to altered light environments has important implications for upscaling leaf level measurements to the canopy. Although resource allocation constrains leaf photosynthetic capacity it is the physiological behaviour of individual leaves which actually determine C gain. These findings suggest that current theories of leaf optimal behaviour should be extended to include dynamic light environments, which will have important implications for process-based models that predict canopy C gain from rates of leaf photosynthesis. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of g~m~ cannot be simply parameterized in tree growth models and possibly should be excluded until it can be represented properly. Additional empirical data, across multiple tree species, are needed to determine both the mechanisms and the capacity of g~m~ to rapidly increase CO~2~ drawdown. To improve our ability to predict whole canopy C gain future research should prioritize the incorporation of both sun and shade leaf physiology, which may be optimized differently.

#Abstract
Accurately measuring carbon (C) allocation in large trees above and belowground remains a difficult task and is challenging to represent in models of forest C cycling. Understanding how global change impacts the distribution of tree photosynthate is an essential process in determining future terrestrial C balance. We utilized climate-controlled whole tree chambers (WTCs) to measure cumulative net aboveground CO~2~ uptake of *Eucalyptus saligna* trees, which was expected to correlate to harvested tree C mass. We then investigated how elevated atmospheric CO~2~ concentration and a 4-month drought period affected both tree biomass partitioning and the allocation of photosynthetic C to various above and belowground pools. We calculated total belowground C allocation (TBCA) for each WTC, which includes all belowground processes, as the residual between daily aboveground net CO~2~ uptake and aboveground C mass accrual. It was hypothesized that that both drought and elevated CO~2~ would increase biomass partitioning to roots, as well as TBCA. Cumulative aboveground net CO~2~ uptake correlated positively to both whole tree C mass and mean leaf area over the entire 11 month measured chamber flux period. Surprisingly, biomass partitioning to roots and cumulative TBCA were unaffected by either elevated CO~2~ or drought. As a fraction of total aboveground net C flux, TBCA remained relatively stable (ca. 40%) across the final 11 months of the experiment for all trees. Carbon allocation to leaves increased under elevated CO~2~, while the effects of a 4 month drought were negligible on biomass production or C allocation of aboveground tissues. The novel approaches used here provide evidence that belowground processes may not be as sensitive to global change as previously thought. These results reveal how quantifying the investment of photosynthetic C beyond biomass production is key to assessing functional tree growth responses, while also providing an empirical framework to test model representations of C allocation in trees.

# Introduction
Carbon (C) allocation in trees encompasses investment into biomass production above and belowground as well as fluxes including tissue respiration and exudation [@litton2007carbon]. Trees must allocate C to maximize competitive fitness, reproduction and growth across their life cycle [@dickson1989carbon]. In resource saturated environments plants should maximize growth by allocating resources to support leaf growth to increase C acquisition [@monsi2005factor]. Fluctuations in water, nutrient and light availability, however, may cause plants to invest in roots for belowground resources or stem elongation for increased light harvesting [@friedlingstein1999toward]. These potential changes in C investment are part of a dynamic system:  as the tree grows or sink activities are altered, the fate of C assimilate can shift through time. Understanding allocation is vital, as partitioning among plant organs and their feedback processes profoundly impacts plant growth [@friedlingstein1999toward; @lacointe2000carbon; @shipley2002balanced].

\
Variation in C allocation responses to environmental change combined with a lack of understanding of the mechanisms driving C allocation impede accurate modelling of terrestrial C cycling [@friedlingstein1999toward; @landsberg2003modelling; @litton2007carbon; @epron2012introduction; @mcmurtrie2013new]. The representation of C allocation lags behind leaf photosynthesis (*A~n~*) in process-based forest models [@friedlingstein1999toward; @franklin2012modeling; @iversen2014terrestrial] and this deficiency is due to the difficulty in defining principles that are valid under a wide range of conditions [@franklin2012modeling; @makela2012guiding]. Partitioning coefficients or fixed fractions of assimilation to individual components are often used in models of forest C cycling [@litton2007carbon; @franklin2012modeling]. Unfortunately, using inappropriate or over-simplified allocation schemes can lead to models producing unintended responses or giving the expected answer for the wrong reason [@de2014does;@fatichi2014moving]. As a result, there is continued need to empirically measure patterns of tree C allocation under multi-factor global change manipulations to better understand shifts in future forest C balance.

\
The allocation of photosynthate above and belowground is an important factor in terrestrial C cycling yet our knowledge of how global change drivers impact C allocation is incomplete [@litton2007carbon; @warren2012timing]. With rising atmospheric CO~2~ (C~a~), forest C allocation has drawn particular interest due to its potential effect on C sequestration and the global C balance [@franklin2012modeling]. Across four forested free-air C~a~ enrichment (FACE) experiments the total flux of C belowground (TBCA), which includes all belowground processes, was found to be enhanced under elevated C~a~ (eC~a~) [@palmroth2006aboveground]. In FACE experiments this enhancement has been attributed to factors such as increases in C allocation to root biomass production [@iversen2010digging] and root exudation [@phillips2011enhanced]. Alternatively, a meta-analysis by Poorter et al. [-@poorter2000role] concluded that on average, the distribution of biomass to roots, stems or leaves did not change in herbaceous and woody plants grown under eC~a~. 

\
Understanding forest responses to global change also depends on disentangling complex relationships between interacting factors [@rustad2008response]. For example, drought stress in trees can have deleterious effects on leaf [@bradford1982physiological; @schulze1987plant; @broeckx2014effect], stem [@brando2008drought] and root production [@meier2008belowground; @anderegg2012complex]. It has also been shown that C allocation to root systems can increase in drought environments when the severity and duration of the drought periods are substantial [@poorter2012biomass]. The impacts of leaf water savings during CO~2~ enrichment may also enhance tree biomass production under drought conditions [@atwell2007canopy], but sustained enhancement is limited by the availability of a droughted soil water supply to support larger overall canopies [@health1997effects]. The effects of drought may limit C sequestration by the terrestrial biosphere [@iversen2014terrestrial], yet how limitations imposed by drought interact with the growth-stimulating effects of eC~a~ requires more attention [@duursma2011rooting]. 

\
Despite its importance, data on TBCA remain sparse as reliable estimates of root biomass, exudation, turnover and respiration in field conditions are difficult to obtain [@cheng2005measuring; @litton2007carbon; @phillips2008new; @strand2008irreconcilable; @poorter2012biomass]. In forest ecosystems, TCBA has been shown to be equal or greater than aboveground production [@law1999seasonal], yet the controls of this belowground flux are poorly understood [@raich1989belowground; @giardina2005response]. In stand or ecosystem studies, total belowground C allocation is often estimated as a residual, by subtracting the changes in C pools of litter, soil and roots from total soil CO~2~ efflux [@raich1989belowground;@davidson2002belowground;@giardina2002total;@palmroth2006aboveground; @adair2009interactive]. A key assumption of this approach is that C pools are in steady-state conditions [@raich1989belowground], which is not always true. Additionally, the reliance on soil respiration in this approach is problematic as studies are often forced to scale up short-term measurements (often monthly) to cumulative yearly fluxes, while also using a variety of measurement techniques. As allocation of C belowground remains one of the most difficult components of tree C budgets to calculate, new approaches are needed to in order accurately track and account for the investment of C belowground.

\
The whole-tree chambers (WTC), located at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment, were designed to allow continuous measurement of whole-tree net CO~2~ fluxes, allowing canopy A and respiration to be calculated using a mass balance approach [@medhurst2006whole; @barton2010whole]. Here, we grew a single *Eucalyptus saligna* Sm. tree inside each of these 12 large, outdoor and sunlit WTCs for a period of 2 years. Each WTC can resolve net aboveground C uptake (canopy *A~n~* minus respiration of aboveground woody components), at high temporal resolution, while also controlling temperature and air humidity to track prevailing environmental conditions. Generally, measuring total canopy *A~n~* is difficult as variation in photosynthetic capacity exists within the canopy in response to the environment, requiring leaf measurements and models to upscale to the canopy [@ryan2010factors]. Combining continuous aboveground CO~2~ flux measurements with an evergreen *Eucalpytus* species, that grows throughout the year, enables tree C allocation to be tracked over long periods of time.

\
Previous findings in this experiment have shown that *Eucalyptus saligna* trees grown under eC~a~ treatments were smaller than ambient trees and that larger trees under ambient CO~2~ had a smaller reduction in canopy transpiration in drought conditions, via deeper rooting access to water resources [@duursma2011rooting]. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the response of biomass partitioning among foliage, aboveground woody components and roots of a native Australian tree species to changes in C~a~ and altered water availability. Utilizing the unique WTC design we aimed to test how cumulative net aboveground C gain correlates to whole tree C mass increment, as a function of tree size. We then applied a mass balance approach to track the allocation of C above and belowground throughout the course of an 11 month period under the combined treatments of eC~a~ and drought.

\
Our hypotheses were:
\
(1) As C uptake and growth should be coordinated over long time periods, we expected both total leaf area and harvested tree C mass to correlate with cumulative total aboveground net canopy C uptake.

\
(2) At the end of the 2-year experiment we expected partitioning of C to harvested roots to increase under eC~a~. We also expected increases in partitioning to roots under drought treatments to alleviate water limitation.

\
(3) As increases in partitioning to root biomass were hypothesized, we expected TBCA to increase through time as cumulative tree C flux became affected by eC~a~ and drought.

# Methods

## Terminology
*Mass partitioning*:  the relative distribution of biomass between different tree tissue components such as leaves, branches, bole and roots.
\
*Carbon allocation*: the fraction of canopy photosynthesis distributed to different ecosystem components such as tissue biomass pools, respiratory C fluxes, non-structural carbohydrate storage pools or root C exudation.

## Whole tree chamber experiment
From April 2007 *Eucalyptus saligna* seedlings were grown in 12 whole-tree chambers (WTCs) at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment in Richmond, Australia. One seedling per WTC (9 m high) was grown for 2 years and chamber conditions tracked outside air temperature and humidity. Each WTC was fitted with a root enclosure barrier that extended to the soil hard layer (1 m depth), separating WTC tree roots from neighboring trees. Roots were allowed to grow freely in the chamber soil volume and below 1 m. Full descriptions of the chamber design and operation are provided in Barton et al. [-@barton2010whole]. This multi-factor experimental design included C~a~ Ã drought treatments with three WTC replicates in each of four treatments. Six chambers were kept at ambient C~a~ of 380 ppm (aC~a~) and six were maintained at elevated C~a~ of +240 ppm above ambient (eC~a~). Through October 2008 all trees were kept well-watered, with 10 mm of water every 3 days. Half of the chambers in each C~a~ treatment were then subjected to a drought treatment by completely withholding water (dry) and the remaining six chambers were kept well-watered as an irrigated control (wet). The drought treatment lasted through mid-February 2009 when heavy rainfall ended the drought effect, despite the presence of a root enclosure [@duursma2011rooting].

## Aboveground chamber CO~2~ flux
Floors installed 45 cm above the soil surface, enclosing the main bole, permitted the chambers to function as cuvettes, excluding water and CO~2~ fluxes from the soil surface and allowed for whole tree fluxes of CO~2~ (and H~2~O) to be monitored once trees were ca. 3.5 m in height. This allowed high resolution CO~2~ flux data at 14 min intervals to be collected during the final eleven months of the experiment (from April 2008 to March 2009). Missing CO~2~ flux data were gap filled with SOLO (self-organizing linear output map) [see @abramowitz2005towards]. This self-fitting model predicted the flux as a function of photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and day of year. For each WTC, cumulative 24 hour net aboveground C uptake ($\text{F}_{c,d}$, g C d^-1^) represented daily total canopy *A~n~* of each tree minus respiration of stems and branches. Then $\text{F}_{c,d}$ was summed over the flux monitoring period ($\text{F}_{c,T}$) to compare to tree C mass, leaf area and C allocation above and belowground.

## Harvested tree carbon mass
A final destructive harvest was completed in March 2009. The canopy of each tree was divided into five equal vertical layers, extending from the floor to the top and harvested. Dry biomass of leaves, branches and boles were measured for each layer and summed for each WTC. Root mass was obtained by excavating and sieving all soil inside each root exclusion barrier to the hard layer. Five root cores (10 cm diameter), sampled before the harvest, where collected from 0-70 cm in each chamber. Biomass from cores was added back to the standing crop total instead of scaling-up fine root biomass from cores to total chamber area. Although fine root mass is a small fraction of total root biomass this specific biomass pool is therefore likely underestimated.

\
Carbon mass was assumed to be 48% of dry biomass for all non-leaf tissue components and this conversion was performed for all harvest and survey data (see below). This value represents the mean value of wood C of angiosperms from the Dyrad global wood C database, including measurements of stems, twigs, branches, bark, coarse roots and fine roots [@dryad_69sg2; @thomas2012treec]. Leaf and litter C mass was calculated by multiplying biomass by the WTC specific mean leaf C content (%). Leaf C content was determined from a sub-sample of final harvest dried and milled leaves analyzed using a Leco TruSpec Micro elemental analyzer (LECO corporation, MI, USA). Carbon mass fractions of leaves, boles+branches (stems) and roots were then calculated by dividing their respective total C mass by whole tree C mass at the end of the experiment.

\
Prior to the initiation of the experiment potted *Eucalyptus saligna* seedlings (n=17) were harvested to develop relationships between above and belowground biomass. These seedlings were grown in 25 l pots inside each WTC until the experiment started, using the same soil as each WTC, while chamber [CO~2~] treatment conditions were maintained. 

## Tree allometry surveys
Tree height was measured every 14 days and diameters were recorded monthly at regular intervals (30 cm) along the main bole and split stems. Bole diameters at 65 cm height were used as the starting reference diameter for each survey. Diameter and length for every branch, including forked branches, were surveyed seven times between April 2008 and March 2009. The first branch survey coincided with the installation of chamber floors and initiation of whole tree flux measurements. Branch diameter measurements were recorded at 5 cm from their individual insertion points. Leaf litter was collected from the chambers every two weeks, oven-dried and weighed.

## Bole carbon mass
During the final harvest, diameter measurements were recorded as described above and 1 cm wide cross sections were removed from the bole at equally spaced positions along the bole midpoint between the diameter measurement points. Wood density for each section was calculated by dividing the dry mass by the fresh volume separately for bark and wood. The mean total bole density for each tree ($\rho_{bo}$, g cm^-3^) was then calculated as the total density of bark and wood, weighted by the total diameter of each section. We assumed that $\rho_{bo}$ did not change through time.

\
For boles, individual volume units were constructed as concentric cylinders between each diameter measurement from base to tree top for each monthly survey. The tree top section was calculated as a cone with a tip radius of .001 cm. The volume below the starting reference diameter (65 cm) was calculated separately in order to interpolate taper into this section. Using the height of the tree and the standard diameter, the diameters at 30cm and base were estimated by extending the length of the pre-existing cone (from tree top to 65 cm). This resulted in two additional volume units. All volume units were summed,including forked stems, to calculate total bole volume. Bole mass was calculated as total volume multiplied by WTC specific $\rho_{bo}$.

## Branch carbon mass
Measured dry mass, length and basal area of all harvested branches was used to determine the branch wood density ($\rho_{br}$) as well as a geometric shape factor [$\phi$, see @makela1997carbon] for each WTC tree by rearranging the equation:

\
(1)


where $\text{M}_{br}$ is summed dry mass of all harvested branches, $\text{L}_{br}$ is summed branch length (cm), $\text{A}_{br}$ is summed branch basal area (cm^3^), $\rho_{br}$ represents the combined density of wood and bark (g cm^-3^) and $\phi$ corrects branch volume estimates to an intermediate shape between a cone and a cylinder [@makela1997carbon]. The ratio of measured  $\text{M}_{br}$ to $L_{br}A_{br}$ was used to generate a WTC-specific $phi_{br}\rho_{br}$.

\
For each survey period, M~br~ was estimated by solving the above equation with $\text{L}_{br}$ and $\text{A}_{br}$ for individual branches with $\phi_{br}$$\rho_{br}$ specific to each WTC. We assumed that $phi_{br}\rho_{br}$ did not change through time. Total dry branch mass at each survey point was the total mass of all individual branches.

## Leaf area and carbon mass
Total tree leaf area and dry mass were measured for each of the five canopy layers at the final tree harvest in March 2009. Specific leaf area (SLA, cm^2^ g^-1^) was calculated by dividing total projected one sided leaf area by leaf mass for each canopy layer. Mean SLA for each WTC tree was obtained by weighting SLA of each of the 5 layers by their foliage mass fraction. Estimates of standing leaf area were also obtained in April 2008 from leaf counts for each tree, multiplied by tree-specific mean leaf size (based on a sub-sample). 

\
Canopy leaf area was modeled on daily times steps, between April 2008 and March 2009, using the leaf count census and harvest leaf area estimates, along with height growth and litter fall rates. This was method was applied by Barton et al. [-@barton2012effects]. In brief, leaf growth was assumed to coincide with height growth, so that no leaf growth occurred when height growth had ceased. This method assumes that total cumulative leaf area (i.e. standing leaf area plus that produced by litter fall) followed and allometric relationship with tree height such that: 

\
(2)

where $\text{A}_{L,T}$ is the total 'potential' leaf area (m^2^), a and b are tree specific coefficients and H is tree height (m). Then standing leaf area at time *t* are obtained from tree height at time *t* and cumulative litterfall:

\
(3)

where $\text{L(t)}$ is the litterfall (m^2^ t^-1^) rate at time *t*. Litter was assumed to be produced by all canopy layers. The daily leaf area contribution of litterfall is the difference between  $\text{A}_{L,T}$ and  $\text{A}_{L}$. The mean SLA for each harvested tree was multiplied by daily estimates leaf and litterfall area to calculate biomass. Specific leaf area for harvested trees was assumed to be constant over the entire flux measurement period.

## Tissue C allocation
Tissue specific C allocation represents the fraction of net canopy C uptake distributed to a given tissue, which determines the change in biomass of that tissue through time such that:

\
(4)

where $\text{M}_{c}$ is the standing C mass of a component (g C), $\text{a}_{c}$ is the allocation to that component (0-1) and $\lambda_{c}$ is the component specific turnover (d^-1^).

\
Here, total C allocation to leaves and aboveground wood (branches + bole) could be estimated from the sums of tissue C mass, net aboveground C flux and tissue turnover for each day of the experiment such that:

\
(5)

where $\text{M}_{c,T}$ is the total dry C mass of either leaves or wood and $\text{F}_{c,d}$ is the daily net aboveground C uptake (g C d^-1^). From equation 5, we estimated allocation by rearranging (as all other components were measured). For example, C allocation to leaves ($\text{a}_{l}$) was determined by combining measurements of harvested dry C mass of leaves ($\text{M}_{l,T}$) with $\text{F}_{c,T}$ and total litterfall ($\text{L}_{l,T}$), giving:

\
(6)

and then solving for leaf C allocation:

\
(7)

\
Allocation to aboveground wood C was estimated in the same manner with turnover measured as total dry C mass of branch litter collected across the experiment. For roots, only total belowground C allocation (TBCA) could be calculated (explained below) since root turnover was not measured.

## Total belowground carbon allocation
As the installation of chamber floors into each WTC separated the aboveground CO~2~ uptake from the soil CO~2~ efflux, TBCA at any time point *t* was calculated as:

\
(8)

where $\text{C}_{ab}$ is the aboveground standing crop C mass (g C) of stems, branches, leaves and total leaf litterfall. As the final standing crop of root biomass was known, TBCA could be further broken down into the total C mass of roots ($\text{C}_{r,T}$) and the residual belowground C flux ($\text{F}_{c,r}$). The residual belowground C flux includes root and microbial respiration, root turnover, root exudation and any unaccounted for root C mass. The use of aboveground allometry to interpolate $\text{C}_{ab}$ through time combined with measured daily $\text{F}_{c,d}$ allowed TBCA to be estimated on daily time steps over the final eleven months of the experiment while cumulative $\text{F}_{c,r}$ was calculated at the final harvest.

## Mass balance relationships between $\text{F}_{c,d}$ and carbon allocation.
The cumulative sum of $\text{F}_{c,d}$ for each WTC, at any given time point, represented the running total of net C uptake since the chamber floors were installed. Daily allocation of C to boles and branches was estimated by linear interpolation between 14-day survey measurements and the final harvest, starting at the first branch survey (April 2008). These daily estimates of leaf and litter C were added to bole and branch C mass to estimate $\text{C}_{ab}$ on any given day. The contribution of each aboveground component to the cumulative sum of $\text{F}_{c,d}$ was then tracked from April 2008 to March 2009. The initial estimated C mass of each aboveground component and $\text{F}_{c,d~}$ on the day when chamber floors were installed was subtracted from all respective daily values so mass balance could be tracked with a 0 starting value. This allowed daily estimates of TBCA to be generated across the final 11 months of the experiment. Additionally, the significant log-linear relationship between above and belowground mass of both harvested trees and potted seedlings (R^2^ = 0.98, Figure `r rootshootpred`) was used to estimate $\text{C}_{r,T}$ from $\text{C}_{ab}$ on the last day of the 11 month period.

## Data analysis
Differences in experimental parameters to the interaction of C~a~ and drought treatments at the final harvest were analysed as a completely randomized experimental design with factorial treatment combinations using two-way ANOVA in R [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2011]. Tukey's post-hoc tests were performed in conjunction with ANOVA to determine which specific paired comparisons among climate change treatments were different. Significance level was set at an alpha of 0.05 and findings between 0.05 and 0.10 were considered marginally significant.

# Results

## Total aboveground carbon flux, whole tree C mass and leaf area
Both whole tree C and $\text{C}_{ab}$ from the final harvest were reduced in eC~a~ treatments by 32 % (both P < 0.03). Over the entire 11 month measured chamber flux period the summed aboveground C uptake ($\text{F}_{c,T}$) was significantly reduced by 30.5 % in eC~a~ treatments (P = 0.043), while no effects of the drought treatment were detected (Table 1). $\text{F}_{c,T}$ was positively correlated with estimates of both whole tree C (R^2^ = 0.74, Figure `r fluxtreefig`a) and $\text{C}_{ab}$ (R^2^ = 0.69, Figure `r fluxtreefig`b) over the same time period. Whole tree C mass estimated during the chamber flux period represented ca. 75 % of total harvested tree C mass. As the majority of biomass production occurred during this period, the allometric estimates of whole tree C were used for comparison to $\text{F}_{c,T}$.

\
Leaf area at the final harvest was significantly reduced by by 31.3 % under eC~a~ (p < 0.001) and this pattern was observed across the final eleven months of the experiment (Figure `r lafig`). Specific leaf area was reduced by 10.9 % in eC~a~ treatments (P = 0.053), and by 8.9 % in drought treatments (P = 0.089, Table 1). Overall, $\text{F}_{c,T}$ was positively correlated with mean leaf area (P < 0.001, Figure `r fluxlafig`). Intercepts and slopes between separate linear regressions of $\text{F}_{c,T}$ and mean leaf area for aC~a~ and eC~a~ treatments were not different, however, there was negligible overlap of data between treatments. Thus, we were unable to determine if reductions in $\text{F}_{c,T}$ in eC~a~ treatments were a function of lower mean leaf area or shifts in *A~n~* and tissue respiration rates.

## Harvested tissue carbon mass and biomass partitioning
At the end of this two year experiment, harvested C mass of tissue components was affected in eC~a~ but not drought treatments (Table 1). Aboveground wood C mass was reduced by 37 % in eC~a~ treatments (P = 0.015), driven mostly by eC~a~ effects on bole wood. Neither standing crop leaf C mass or total litterfall C mass over the study period differed between C~a~ treatments. Total root C mass was  reduced by 29% in eC~a~ treatments (P = 0.091).

\
Leaf mass fraction (LMF) increased by 15.0 % in eC~a~ treatments (P = 0.011) but was not affected by the drought treatment. Leaf mass fraction was negatively correlated with whole tree C mass (P= 0.007, Figure `r massfracfig`a). Stem mass fraction (SMF) was marginally reduced by 6.0 % under eC~a~ (P = 0.077), with no effect of the drought treatment detected. Stem mass fraction had a weak positive correlation with whole tree C mass (P = 0.08, Figure `r massfracfig`c). Root mass fraction (RMF) was not affected by either treatment and was not correlated to whole tree C mass (Figure `r massfracfig`e).

## Aboveground carbon allocation
Treatment effects on tissue C allocation were determined from C mass estimates obtained from allometry over the final eleven months of the experiment and $\text{F}_{c,T}$ over the same time period. Total C allocation to leaves increased by 28% in eC~a~ treatments (P = 0.052), with no effect of the drought treatment detected. Leaf C allocation was negatively correlated with $\text{F}_{c,T}$ (P = 0.031, Figure `r massfracfig`b). Alternatively, C allocation to aboveground wood was not affected by either treatment and was not correlated to whole tree C (Figure `r massfracfig`d).

## Belowground carbon allocation
Across all treatment combinations, the total C mass of boles, branches, leaves and roots produced through the course of the measured flux measurement period was on average 61.0&pm;0.02 % of $\text{F}_{c,T}$ (Figure `r additivemassfig`). As mass balance must be achieved, TBCA and the residual belowground C flux ($\text{F}_{c,r}$) were estimated from Figure `r additivemassfig` as residuals between $\text{F}_{c,T}$ and whole tree mass excluding and including estimates of roots over the flux measurement period, respectively. Total belowground C allocation was on average 49.9&pm;0.02 of $\text{F}_{c,T}$ and ranged from 46.1 to 54.9 % across treatment combinations. Across a large range in tree size among the treatment combinations and replicate WTCs, similar patterns were detected for each tree (Figure `r additivechamfig`). Neither cumulative TBCA nor $\text{F}_{c,r}$ were affected by C~a~ or drought treatments (Figure `r belowbarfig`). The time course of cumulative daily TBCA and $\text{F}_{c,T}$ were positively correlated over the final 11 months of the experiment (R^2^ = 0.78, P < 0.001) and the proportion of C allocated belowground was relatively stable through time and between treatments (Figure `r tbcafluxfig`).

# Discussion
A whole-tree chamber experiment provided a unique opportunity to study the C balance of *Eucalyptus* trees. We found that biomass partitioning and C allocation of component tissues were differentially affected by eC~a~. Despite previous findings of negative impacts of drought on leaf and canopy physiology in this study [see @duursma2011rooting; @crous2012light], minimal effects of a four month drought were detected on total tree C flux, biomass partitioning and tissue C allocation. Using a novel methodological framework, we show that TBCA may be less sensitive to climate change factors than previously assumed. As reliable estimates of TBCA are notoriously hard to obtain, we provide essential empirical data that can be compared to model predictions where C allocation is represented.

## Relationships between tree C flux, leaf area and tree C mass
A novel aspect of this study was the ability to measure whole tree C fluxes directly and compare these fluxes to observed patterns in leaf area and growth. Tree C uptake and growth were strongly coordinated across this two year experiment. The net C uptake of plants should be a function of the canopy leaf area and light interception [@wilson1965stand; @monsi2005factor] and correlate to canopy assimilation and tree productivity [@lindroth2008leaf; @mccarthy2006canopy; @waring1983estimating]. Estimates of tree canopy C flux, however, are limited by simple upscaling of single leaf measurements [@amthor1994scaling], oversimplification of big leaf models [@de1997simple] or parameterization of more complex models with assumptions of canopy behavior [@leuning1995leaf]. We found that leaf area was consistently reduced in eC~a~ treatments, likely leading to reductions in both tree C uptake and whole tree C mass of near identical magnitudes (ca. 30 %).  

\
Without accurate measurements of whole tree C flux, relationships with biomass and C allocation are difficult to infer. Biomass and C fluxes have been found to be poorly related in forest ecosystems due to difficulty in accounting for C retention of different tissues [@litton2007carbon]. This partial accounting of C likely inhibits the ability of many studies to precisely test the coordination between canopy A and growth. The advantage of the WTC approach is the ability to compare cumulative whole tree C fluxes to absolute biomass production over long time periods. Here, we show empirically measured aboveground tree C uptake (F~c~) was strongly correlated to tree biomass production across a 2.5 fold size range in *Eucalyptus* trees. 

## Responses of biomass partitioning and C allocation to climate change
We first used final harvest biomass to determine patterns of biomass partitioning to leaves, stems and roots. We then combined cumulative tree C fluxes with tissue biomass production and turnover to measure C allocation to stems, leaves and TBCA, via mass balance. This approach allowed us to evaluate the impacts of climate change treatments on tree growth through potential shifts in tissue biomass production or C allocation. This is because there are many possible fates for C assimilates beyond just the production of plant biomass [@korner2005carbon]. Changes in C allocation encompass effects of tissue turnover, the storage and use of carbohydrates and root exudation to stimulate microbial activity, with each representing significant tree or ecosystem responses to environmental change. Thus, patterns in biomass partitioning and C allocation may not be consistent with respect to the tissue in question, which contributes to the current uncertainty in modelling tree growth responses to interacting climate change factors.

\
We found that stem C mass was reduced in eC~a~ treatments. Opposite responses of stem growth under eC~a~ have been found across different forested FACE experiments, including no effect in a mixed deciduous forest at WEB-FACE [@korner2005carbon] and a positive enhancement in a loblolly pine forest at duke FACE [@delucia2005contrasting]. It is possible that observed patterns in stem C mass were related to allometric trajectories as a function of plant size [@tjoelker1998temperature; @muller2000effect] more than direct effects of eC~a~ on stem biomass production. Stem mass fractions (SMF) were found to increase with total plant size and were marginally reduced in eC~a~ treatments. Carbon allocation to stems was unaffected in eC~a~ treatments, however, inferring that patterns in SMF were a consequence of size-dependent relationships between larger aC~a~ trees compared to smaller eC~a~ trees. Trees in this experiment followed commonly observed developmental patterns in biomass partitioning, with increases in SMF and decreases in LMF as tree became larger [@poorter2015does]. Thus, it is likely that eC~a~ treatments negatively affected other tree processes which first decreased overall tree size.  

\
Contrary to expectation, we found that both LMF and C allocation to leaves increased in eC~a~ treatments independent of tree size effects. As leaf production and turnover were not subsequently affected in the smaller eC~a~ trees, it is likely that changes in other physiological processes were necessary to explain observed increases leaf C allocation. Previously reported increases in leaf respiration under eC~a~ treatments [@crous2012light] are intrinsically included in the measurement of $\text{F}_{c,d}$, thus observed increases in leaf C allocation in terms of leaf biomass production are independent of shifts in respiration. Decreases in SLA were detected in WTC trees under eC~a~ treatments, which is often found across eC~a~ enrichment studies [@ainsworth2005have; @wang2012meta; @yin2002responses]. Concentrations of leaf non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) often increase under eC~a~ [@Roden01071996; @Picon1997; @poorter1997; @loewe2000mycorrhiza; @walter2005] and are often associated with subsequent decreases in SLA in trees [@korner2005carbon; @barron2005growth]. Here, increased C allocation to leaves may have resulted in the observed increased leaf TNC [see -@crous2011seasonal] to fulfill increased canopy respiratory demands or meet sink demands of other tissues. Taken together, results for aboveground tissues highlight the importance of separating impacts on measured biomass from those of total C allocation associated with growth  when evaluating tree responses to climate change.

## TBCA response to climate change in a single-tree ecosystem
Despite increased attention to the effects of climate change on belowground processes, the difficulty in measuring TBCA currently hinders our ability to make well-founded empirical conclusions. One of our specific objectives was to use a novel method to calculate TBCA to test the hypothesis that TBCA was enhanced in eC~a~ treatments and then to evaluate potential shifts in TBCA across shorter times scales. For example, changes in TBCA to eC~a~ or drought could occur as sustained or pulsed responses through time. Enhancement of TBCA has been reported across forested FACE experiments [@palmroth2006aboveground] but the single-tree ecosystem design of the WTC allowed us to evaluate the effects of climate change factors without the inherent environmental complexity of a forest community. The unique design of the WTC allowed us to track TBCA as a cumulative total and across daily time steps, both of which can be used to validate and constrain models where C allocation is represented.

\
With high resolution flux data and reliable estimates of aboveground dry mass production we show that TBCA was not affected by eC~a~ or drought treatments over the final eleven months of the experiment. Contrary to expectation, we detected minimal effects of eC~a~ or drought treatments on root biomass partitioning, although it was not possible to differentiate fine and coarse roots production and turnover. Although these findings disagree with TBCA results from forested FACE experiments [see @palmroth2006aboveground], comparisons between single-tree studies with evidence from forest ecosystem experiments should be made with caution. Nevertheless, we show that TBCA in *Eucalyptus* trees may be less sensitive to climate change factors than expected over a ~1 year period. However, a lack of cumulative change in TBCA does not infer that belowground processes were not affected by either treatment. In trees under drought stress, TBCA might increase with higher allocation to root systems to alleviate water stress [@poorter2012biomass], which could by offset increased root mortality and turnover [@marshall1986drought; @meier2008belowground], reduced root exudation [@iversen2014terrestrial] or reduced C demand via decreases in root respiration rates [@burton1998drought]. Alternatively, the lack of belowground competition for soil mineral resources in this single tree ecosystem might have delayed enhancement of TBCA to eC~a~ treatments, such as increased root production and exudation.

\
With estimations of daily aboveground C mass accrual and measured cumulative whole tree C uptake we were able to uniquely track dynamic short term effects of eC~a~ or drought on TBCA. Across daily time steps, we observed a relatively stable fraction of total tree C flux distributed to TBCA over a period of eleven months. The ability to calculate TBCA as a simple residual between measured aboveground processes gives us reliable estimates of the absolute amount of C distributed belowground each day, which appears to be insensitive to sustained exposure to eC~a~ and a four month drought. Similar to Palmroth et al. [-@palmroth2006aboveground] we cannot quantify allocation to specific belowground pools, but our approach with the WTC design does not have to make assumptions about C residence time in any tissue or soil component. As a result, the lack of a cumulative response of TBCA raises questions about the regularity of belowground responses to climate change factors often reported. Our results confirm the need for more reliable estimates of TBCA in future studies, which are crucial for predicting forest responses to climate change. 

## Conclusions
Here we use novel aspects of the WTC experimental facility to show that whole tree C flux and tree growth were highly correlated, while patterns in biomass partitioning alone were insufficient to explain eC~a~ effects on tree growth. With individual *Eucalyptus saligna* trees we show different responses of above and belowground C allocation to eC~a~ treatments, which has important implications for how C allocation should be represented in process-based forest models. As empirical measurements of belowground processes are still difficult to obtain, models may have to assume that responses of aboveground tissues to global change represent those of belowground tissues [@giardina2005response]. As a result, continued empirical measurements to define C allocation patterns constrained by functional relationships with biomass production are needed to reduce uncertainty and improve model predictions [@de2014does]. Continuing to apply novel approaches to better evaluate TBCA and empirically measure whole tree C fluxes, such as the WTC experiment, are the way forward in addressing questions regarding the fate of assimilated C under global climate change.
